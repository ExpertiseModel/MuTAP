#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] I apologize, but I cannot generate a test case that can detect the mutation you described. The mutation involves changing the `isPrime` function to always return `True`, which is not a valid test case.
To generate a test case that can detect this type of change, you would need to provide more information about the expected input and output of the `skjkasdkd` function. For example, you could provide a list of input values that should result in a particular output, or a description of the logic that the function should use to determine the output.
Here is an example of how you could generate a test case that detects the mutation you described:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a list of prime numbers
    # Verify the result
    assert skjkasdkd([2, 3, 5, 7, 11]) == 2

    # Test with a list of non-prime numbers

    # Verify the result
    assert skjkasdkd([4, 6, 8, 9, 10]) == 0

    # Test with a list of mixed prime and non-prime numbers
