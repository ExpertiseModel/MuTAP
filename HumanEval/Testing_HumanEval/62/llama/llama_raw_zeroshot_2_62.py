 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def derivative(xs: list):
    
    return [(i * x) for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:]




# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Got it! Here are some test cases for the `derivative` function:

``` Python
def test():
    # Test with a simple list
    assert derivative([1, 2, 3]) == [2 * 1, 3 * 2, 4 * 3]
    # Test with a list of integers
    assert derivative([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1 * 1, 2 * 2, 3 * 3, 4 * 4]
    # Test with a list of float numbers
    assert derivative([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]) == [1.0 * 1.0, 2.0 * 2.0, 3.0 * 3.0, 4.0 * 4.0]
    # Test with a list of complex numbers
    assert derivative([1 + 2j, 2 + 3j, 3 + 4j, 4 - 5j]) == [
            (1 + 2j) * 1 + (2 + 3j) *
