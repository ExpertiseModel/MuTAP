#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    assert can_arrange([3, 4, 5, 2, 1, 6]) == 4

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.

    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. The previous test cases were relying on the fact that the function `can_arrange` always returned the index of the first element in the array that was greater than its predecessor. However, the modified version of the function does not follow this behavior anymore.
To detect this change, we can add a test case that verifies the return value of the function for a different input. Here's an example test case:
```python
def test():
    # Test the function with an array that has no pairs of equal elements
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    assert can_arrange(arr) == 5
    # Test the function with an array that has pairs of equal elements
    arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    assert can_arrange(arr) == 2
```
In this test case, we provide the function with two different inputs: an array with no pairs of equal elements (`arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`), and an
