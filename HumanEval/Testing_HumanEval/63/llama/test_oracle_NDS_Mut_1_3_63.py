#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)




# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert fibfib(3) == 1

    assert fibfib(1) == 0
    assert fibfib(2) == 1
    assert fibfib(3) == 1

    if n == 1:
        return 0

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. The previous test cases are not able to detect the change in the `fibfib` function because they are only checking the value of `fibfib(n)` for a specific `n` value, without considering the updated logic of the function.
To generate a new test case that can detect the change, we can modify the existing test case to check if the returned value of `fibfib` is equal to the expected value, regardless of the `n` value. Here's an example of how we can modify the `test()` function:
```python
def test():
    # Check the return value of fibfib for different inputs
    assert fibfib(3) == 1
    assert fibfib(1) == 0
    assert fibfib(2) == 1
    assert fibfib(3) == 2

```
This new test case will check if the value returned by `fibfib` for `n = 3` is equal to `1`, and also check if the value returned for `n = 1`, `n = 2`, and `n = 3` are
