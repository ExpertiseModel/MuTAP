#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def fibfib(n: int):
    
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)




# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert fibfib(3) == 1

    assert fibfib(1) == 0
    assert fibfib(2) == 1
    assert fibfib(3) == 1

 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def fibfib(n: int):
    
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if n != 2:
        return 1
    return fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure! Here's a new test case that can detect the change in the `fibfib` function:
```python
def test():
    assert fibfib(3) == 1

    assert fibfib(1) == 0
    assert fibfib(2) == 1
    assert fibfib(3) == 2

```
In this new test case, we've added a third assertion to check that the return value of `fibfib(3)` is `2`. This will catch the change in the function where the default return value for `n != 2` is changed to `1`.
Note that we're using a list comprehension to create a list of three assertions in the `test` function. Each assertion is a statement that returns a boolean value indicating whether the test case passed or failed.
