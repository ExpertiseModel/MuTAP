#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def fibfib(n: int):
    
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)




# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert fibfib(3) == 1

    assert fibfib(1) == 0
    assert fibfib(2) == 1
    assert fibfib(3) == 1

 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def fibfib(n: int):
    
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return (fibfib(n - 1) - fibfib(n - 2)) + fibfib(n - 3)



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the problem. The test cases in the original code snippet are only testing the basic cases of `n == 0`, `n == 1`, and `n == 2`, and are not accounting for the change in the function's logic.
To detect the change in the function's logic, we need to write a test case that verifies that the function is returning the correct result for a specific set of inputs. Here's an example:
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert fibfib(3) == 1
    assert fibfib(1) == 0
    assert fibfib(2) == 1
    assert fibfib(4) == 2


```
This test case adds two more inputs to the function: `n = 4`, which the original test cases did not cover. By testing these additional inputs, we can ensure that the function is working correctly and returning the correct results for all valid inputs.
