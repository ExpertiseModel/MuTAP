#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def fibfib(n: int):
    
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)




# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert fibfib(3) == 1

    assert fibfib(1) == 0
    assert fibfib(2) == 1
    assert fibfib(3) == 1

 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test(), cannot detect the mutation in the following code snippet.
```python
def fibfib(n: int):
    
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if n != 2:

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. The previous test cases were only verifying the base cases and the recursive calls, but not the mutation in the middle of the function. Here's a new test case to detect the change you introduced:
```python
# test case
def test():
    with pytest.raises(AssertionError):
        fibfib(3)

```
This new test case will raise an `AssertionError` if the function `fibfib` returns anything other than `1` for the input `3`.
Alternatively, you can also use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to parameterize the test case and run it for multiple inputs, like this:
```python
# test case
@pytest.mark.parametrize("n", [3, 4, 5])
def test():
    assert fibfib(n) == 1
```
This will run the test case for `n` equal to 3, 4, and 5, and raise an `AssertionError` if the function returns anything other than `1` for any of those inputs.
