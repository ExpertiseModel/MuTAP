#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def fibfib(n: int):
    
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)




# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert fibfib(3) == 1

    assert fibfib(1) == 0
    assert fibfib(2) == 1
    assert fibfib(3) == 1

 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test(), cannot detect the mutation in the following code snippet.
```python
def fibfib(n: int):
    
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return (fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2)) - fibfib(n - 3)



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  To detect the mutation in the `fibfib` function caused by the change in the logic, we can add a test case that checks the result of the function for a specific input. In this case, we can add a test case that checks if `fibfib(3)` returns `1`, which it should not do if the mutation is present. Here's an updated `test` function with the new test case:
```python
def test():
    # Mutation test case
    assert fibfib(3) != 1

    # Regression test cases
    assert fibfib(1) == 0
    assert fibfib(2) == 1
    assert fibfib(3) == 1

```
The new test case will check if `fibfib(3)` returns `1`, which it should not do if the mutation is present. If the mutation is present, this test case will fail, indicating that the function has changed.
