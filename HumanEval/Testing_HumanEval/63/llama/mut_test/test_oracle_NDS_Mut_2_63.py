#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def fibfib(n: int):
    
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if n == 2:
        return 1
    return fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)




# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert fibfib(3) == 1

    assert fibfib(1) == 0
    assert fibfib(2) == 1
    assert fibfib(3) == 1

 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test(), cannot detect the mutation in the following code snippet.
```python
def fibfib(n: int):
    
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    if not (n == 2):
        return 1
    return fibfib(n - 1) + fibfib(n - 2) + fibfib(n - 3)



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see. In that case, you can use the following test case to detect the mutation in the `fibfib` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a value that triggers the mutation (i.e. n = 3)
    assert fibfib(3) == 3
    # Test with a value that should still pass (i.e. n = 2)
    assert fibfib(2) == 1
    # Test with a value that should fail (i.e. n = 4)
    assert fibfib(4) != 1
```
This test case will pass when the `fibfib` function is executed with a value of `n = 3`, and it will fail when the function is executed with a value of `n = 4`, which triggers the mutation in the `if Not` statement.
