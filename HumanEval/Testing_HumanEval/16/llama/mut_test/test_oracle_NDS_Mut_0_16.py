#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    
    return len(set(string.lower()))




# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    # Valid strings should return a correct count of distinct characters
    assert count_distinct_characters("hello") == 4
    assert count_distinct_characters("abc") == 3
    assert count_distinct_characters("hello world") == 8

    # The function should return 0 for an empty string
    assert count_distinct_characters("") == 0

    # Special characters should be handled correctly
    assert count_distinct_characters("\u0000") == 1
    assert count_distinct_characters("\u00ff") == 1

    # Lowercase and uppercase strings should be handled correctly
    assert count_distinct_characters("HeLlo") == 4
    assert count_distinct_characters("hello") == 4

 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test(), cannot detect the mutation in the following code snippet.
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    
    return len(set(string.upper()))



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. You are correct that the test cases I generated cannot detect the mutation in the modified code snippet. Here is a new test case that can detect the difference:
```python
def test():
    # Call the function with a string that contains both uppercase and lowercase characters
    string = "Hello World"
    # Mutation: Change the function to uppercase
    assert count_distinct_characters("HELLO WORLD") != count_distinct_characters(string)

```
This test case will check if the function returns the same value when called with a string that contains both uppercase and lowercase characters, and if the modified function returns a different value.
