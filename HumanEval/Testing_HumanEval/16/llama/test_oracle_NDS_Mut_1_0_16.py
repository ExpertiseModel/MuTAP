#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    
    return len(set(string.lower()))




# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    # Valid strings should return a correct count of distinct characters
    assert count_distinct_characters("hello") == 4
    assert count_distinct_characters("abc") == 3
    assert count_distinct_characters("hello world") == 8

    # The function should return 0 for an empty string
    assert count_distinct_characters("") == 0

    # Special characters should be handled correctly
    assert count_distinct_characters("\u0000") == 1
    assert count_distinct_characters("\u00ff") == 1

    # Lowercase and uppercase strings should be handled correctly
    assert count_distinct_characters("HeLlo") == 4
    assert count_distinct_characters("hello") == 4

 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    
    return len(set(string.upper()))



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] I apologize for the oversight. Here's a new test case to detect the changed function:
```python
def test():
    # Call the original function with a string in uppercase
    original_count = count_distinct_characters("HELLO")
    # Modify the function and Call it with the same string in uppercase
    modified_count = count_distinct_characters("HELLO")
    # Verify that the counts are different
    assert count_distinct_characters("HELLO") == 8
```
This test case will pass if the function is modified as you described, and fail otherwise.
