#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    
    return len(set(string.lower()))





``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert count_distinct_characters("") == 0


    assert count_distinct_characters("hello") == 4

    assert count_distinct_characters("HeLlO") == 4

    assert count_distinct_characters("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.") == 28

    assert count_distinct_characters("   hello   ") == 5

    assert count_distinct_characters("Hello, world!") == 10

    assert count_distinct_characters("ðŸ˜Š") == 1
#</test>
 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    
    return len(set(string.upper()))



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure, here's a new test case that can detect the change in the `count_distinct_characters` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test the original implementation
    assert count_distinct_characters("hello") == 4
    # Test the modified implementation with uppercase letters
    assert count_distinct_characters("HELLO") == 5
    # Test with a mixed case string
    assert count_distinct_characters("It is a good day to jump") == 16
    # Test with a string containing only uppercase letters
    assert count_distinct_characters("HELLO World!") == 4
#</test>
```
This new test case adds a few more test cases to cover the following scenarios:

* A string containing only uppercase letters
* A string with mixed case letters
* A string with multiple occurrences of the same character
By adding these test cases, we can ensure that the `count_distinct_characters` function is robust and can handle a variety of inputs.
