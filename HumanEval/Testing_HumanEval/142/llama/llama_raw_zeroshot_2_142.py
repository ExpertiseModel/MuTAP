 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def sum_squares(lst):
    """"
    This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a 
    multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not 
    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. 
    
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6
    For lst = []  the output should be 0
    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126
    """
    result =[]
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i %3 == 0:
            result.append(lst[i]**2)
        elif i % 4 == 0 and i%3 != 0:
            result.append(lst[i]**3)
        else:
            result.append(lst[i])
    return sum(result)


# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Of course! Here are some test cases for the `sum_squares` function:
1. ` Test case: [1, 2, 3]`
Expected output: `6`
Code to test: `result = sum_squares([1, 2, 3]); assert result == 6`
2. ` Test case: []`
Expected output: `0`
Code to test: `result = sum_squaries([]); assert result == 0`
3. ` Test case: [-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]`
Expected output: `-126`
Code to test: `result = sum_squares([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]); assert result == -126`
4. ` Test case: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
Expected output: `21`
Code to test: `result = sum_squares([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); assert result == 21`


Would you like me to add more test cases?
