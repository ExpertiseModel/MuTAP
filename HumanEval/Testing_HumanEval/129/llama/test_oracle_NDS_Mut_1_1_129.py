#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Ah, I see the issue. The previous test cases were only checking the value of `val` and `ans` in the first few iterations of the loop, and were not checking the change in the code that you mentioned.
Here's a new test case that should detect the change in the code:
```python
def test():
    # Test 3: Invalid grid, invalid k, raises ValueError
    grid = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
    k = 4 # k is greater than the length of the grid
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
    minPath(grid, k)
```
This test case should raise a `ValueError` when the `k` value is greater than the length of the grid, which is the change that you mentioned in the code.
Let me know if you have any other questions or if you need further assistance!
