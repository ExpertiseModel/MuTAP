        neg = 1
        if n < 0: 
            n, neg = -1 * n, -1 
        n = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
        n[0] = n[0] * neg

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Great, I can help you generate a new test case to detect the change in the function `count_nums`. Here is a possible test case:
```python
def test():
    # Call the function with a new input
    assert count_nums([4, 2, 6, 8, -3, -1, 3, 1]) == 5
    # Check that the output is different from the previous input
    assert count_nums([4, 2, 6, 8, -3, -1, -1, -1, 3, 1]) != 6
```
This new test case checks that the output of the function is different when the input has a negative number. In the previous test cases, all the inputs were positive, so the function returned the same value for all of them. But now, one of the inputs is negative, so the function should return a different value.
