#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] I understand, you want me to generate a new test case that can detect the change in the code snippet you provided. Here is an example of a new test case that can catch the issue:
```python
def test():
    arr = [4, 2, 6, 8, -1, -1, -1, 3, 1, -2]
    assert count_nums(arr) == 6
    # Changing the code to pass the test
    arr = [4, 2, 6, 8, -1, -1, -1, 3, 1, -2, -1]
    assert count_nums(arr) == 5
```
In this test case, we added an additional element to the input array `arr` that is negative, `arr = [4, 2, 6, 8, -1, -1, -1, 3, 1, -2, -1]`. The function `count_nums` should return 5 in this case, as the negative number is being counted as a negative number.
The test case also includes the original input `arr` to verify
