 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def f(n):
    """ Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    Example:

# test case

```python
def test_f_1():
    # n = 1
    result = f(1)
    assert result == [1]

def test_f_2():
    # n = 2
    result = f(2)
    assert result == [1, 2, 2, 1]

def test_f_3():
    # n = 3
    result = f(3)
    assert result == [1, 2, 3, 6, 1]

def test_f_4():
    # n = 4
    result = f(4)
    assert result == [1, 2, 3, 4, 24, 15]

def test_f_5():
    # n = 5
    result = f(5)
    assert result == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]

def test_f_6():
    # n = 6
    result = f(6)
