 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test(), cannot detect the mutation in the following code snippet.
```python
def match_parens(lst):
    '''
    You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open
    parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only.
    Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in
    some order, that the resulting string will be good.
    A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S
    are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string
    '())' is not.
    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

    Examples:
    match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'
    match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'
    '''
    def check(s):
        val = 0
        for i in s:
            if i == '(':
                val = val + 1
            else:
                val = val - 1
            if val < 0:
                return False
        return True if val == 0 else False

    S1 = lst[0] + lst[1]
    S2 = lst[1] + lst[0]
    return 'Yes' if (check(S1) and check(S2)) else 'No'

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] I understand, here's a new test case that can detect the mutation in the `match_parens` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test 7: Two strings with conflicting '(' and ')'

    assert match_parens(['(()', '()']) == 'No'

    # Test 8: Two strings with the same '(' and ')' in different positions

    assert match_parens(['(()', '()']) == 'No'

    # Test 9: Two strings with nested '(' and ')' in different positions

    assert match_parens(['(())', '(()']) == 'No'

    # Test 10: Two strings with conflicting '(' and ')' in the same position

    assert match_parens(['(())', '()']) == 'No'

```
In this new test case, we added two new test cases (Test 7 and Test 8) that check for conflicting '(' and ')' in the same string. In Test 7, we give the function two strings with conflicting '(' and ')' in the same position, and in Test
