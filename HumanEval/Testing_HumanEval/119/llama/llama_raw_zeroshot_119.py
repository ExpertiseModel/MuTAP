#original function
def match_parens(lst):
    '''
    You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open
    parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only.
    Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in
    some order, that the resulting string will be good.
    A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S
    are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string
    '())' is not.
    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

    Examples:
    match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'
    match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'
    '''
    def check(s):
        val = 0
        for i in s:
            if i == '(':
                val = val + 1
            else:
                val = val - 1
            if val < 0:
                return False
        return True if val == 0 else False

    S1 = lst[0] + lst[1]
    S2 = lst[1] + lst[0]
    return 'Yes' if check(S1) or check(S2) else 'No'


# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure, here are some test cases for the `match_parens` function:
1. `match_parens(['()', '(()')]` should return `Yes` because we can concatenate the two strings to get `((()))`.
2. `match_parens(['))', '()'])>` should return `No` because there is no way to concatenate the two strings to get a valid string.
3. `match_parens(['(abc)', 'def'))]` should return `Yes` because we can concatenate the two strings to get `((abc)def)`.
4. `match_parens(['))', '(abc))]` should return `Yes` because we can concatenate the two strings to get `((abc))`.
5. `match_parens(['()', 'def'])>` should return `No` because there is no way to concatenate the two strings to get a valid string.
Here's the code to implement these test cases:
```python
def test():
    # Test 1: Two () strings
    assert match_parens(['()', '(()']) == 'Yes'
    # Test 2: Two ) strings
