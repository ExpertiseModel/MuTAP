#original function
def match_parens(lst):
    '''
    You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open
    parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only.
    Your job is to check if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in
    some order, that the resulting string will be good.
    A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S
    are balanced. For example: the string '(())()' is good, while the string
    '())' is not.
    Return 'Yes' if there's a way to make a good string, and return 'No' otherwise.

    Examples:
    match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'
    match_parens([')', ')']) == 'No'
    '''
    def check(s):
        val = 0
        for i in s:
            if i == '(':
                val = val + 1
            else:
                val = val - 1
            if val < 0:
                return False
        return True if val == 0 else False

    S1 = lst[0] + lst[1]
    S2 = lst[1] + lst[0]
    return 'Yes' if check(S1) or check(S2) else 'No'


# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Of course! Here are some test cases for the `match_parens` function:
---
## Test 1: Two strings with only '(' and ')'
```python
assert match_parens(['()', '()']) == 'Yes'

---
## Test 2: Two strings with '(' and ')' in different positions
```python
assert match_parens(['(())', '()']) == 'Yes'

---
## Test 3: Two strings with '(' and ')' in the same position
```python
assert match_parens(['( )', '()']) == 'No'

---
## Test 4: Two strings with nested '(' and ')'
```python
assert match_parens(['((()))', '((()))']) == 'Yes'

---
## Test 5: Two strings with conflicting '(' and ')'
```python
assert match_parens(['(()))', '()']) == 'No'

---
## Test 6: Two strings with varying number of '(' and ')'
```python
assert match_parens(['((()))', '()']) == 'Yes'
