#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

        else:
            i += 1

    if n > 1:
        fact.append(n)
    return fact




#</original code>

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert factorize(3) == [3]
    assert factorize(4) == [2, 2]
    assert factorize(6) == [2, 3]
    assert factorize(8) == [2, 2, 2]
    assert factorize(10) == [2, 5]
    assert factorize(12) == [2, 2, 3]
 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
from typing import List


def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    
    import math
    fact = []
    i = 2
    while i < int(math.sqrt(n) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            fact.append(i)
            n //= i
        else:
            i += 1

    if n > 1:
        fact.append(n)
    return fact



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] To detect the change in the code snippet, you can add a new test case that checks for the number of elements in the `fact` list. Here is an example of how you can modify the `test()` function to include this new test case:
```python
def test():
    assert factorize(3) == [3]
    assert factorize(4) == [2, 2]
    assert factorize(6) == [2, 3]
    assert factorize(8) == [2, 2, 2]
    assert factorize(10) == [2, 5]
    # new test case
    assert len(factorize(12)) == 3  # check that the list has 3 elements
```
This new test case will fail if the `factorize()` function is changed to return a list with a different number of elements (e.g., if the function is changed to return a list with only 2 elements for the input `n = 12`).
