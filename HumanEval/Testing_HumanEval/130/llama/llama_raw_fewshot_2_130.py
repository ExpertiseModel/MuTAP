 These are two examples of codes and their tests.

def tri(n):
    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]
    """
    if n == 0:
        return [1]
    my_tri = [1, 3]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)
        else:
            my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)
    return my_tri


#</original code>

generate test in the form of above example tests for the original code:

#<test>
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Of course! Here are some test cases for the `tri` function:
```python
#<test>

def test():
    assert tri(3) == [1, 3, 2, 8]
    assert tri(4) == [3]
    assert tri(5) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 10]
    assert tri(6) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 10, 14]
    assert tri(7) == [1, 3, 2, 8, 10, 14, 21]
#</test>

And here are some examples of how you could use the `tri` function:
```python
#<code>

def main():
    print(tri(5))

main()

#</code>

This will print `[1, 3, 2, 8, 10]`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
