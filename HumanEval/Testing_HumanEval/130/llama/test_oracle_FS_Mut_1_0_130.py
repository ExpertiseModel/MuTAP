#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def tri(n):
    """Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in 
    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:
    tri(1) = 3
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.
    For example:
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2
    tri(4) = 3
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the 
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.
    Examples:
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]

# test case
def test():

def test():
    assert tri(3) == [1, 3, 2, 8]
    assert tri(4) == [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0, 3.0]
    # Add a new test case to detect the change in the function
    # modular arithmetic
    assert tri(5) == [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0, 3.0, 15.0]
    # test for modular arithmetic
    assert tri(5, mod=5) == [1, 3, 2.0, 8.0, 3.0, 15.0]
```
This new test case checks whether the function `tri` returns the correct result when the `mod` parameter is passed with a value other than `None`. In this case, it checks that `tri(5, mod=5)` returns the same result as `tri(5)`.
