    assert [/INST]  I understand, you want me to generate a new test case to detect the change in the code snippet you provided. Here is an updated `test` function that includes a new test case to check for the change:
```python
def test():
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with empty lists
    assert triangle_area([], [], []) == -1
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1

    # Test for the changed code
    # The if statement should be outside the calculation of s
    # Test case: unexpected result with out-of-order operands
    assert triangle_area(2, 3,
