        return -1 
    s = ((a - b) + c) / 2
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Certainly! Here's a new test case to detect the mutation in the `triangle_area` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1
    # Test with empty lists
    assert triangle_area([], [], []) == -1
    # Test with a small positive number
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3.5) == -1
    # Test with a large negative number
    assert triangle_area(10, -20, -30) == -1

```
This new test case will check the `triangle_area` function with a large positive number, a small positive number, a large negative number, and a small negative number. It will also check the function with empty lists and with a small positive number that is not an integer. By adding these
