    assert [/INST]  Sure, I can generate a new test case to detect the mutation in the `triangle_area` function. Here's an example of how you can modify the existing `test` function to detect the change:
```python
def test():
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with empty lists
    assert triangle_area([], [], []) == -1
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1

    # Test with the mutated function
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3, 4) == -1

```
The new test case checks the ` triangle_area` function with an extra
