#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python

def test():
    assert [/INST]  To detect the mutation in the `triangle_area` function caused by the addition of the `/` operator in the calculation of `area`, we can add a new test case that checks for a value of `area` that is neither `-1` nor a finite number. Here's an updated `test` function that includes this new test case:
```python
def test():
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with empty lists
    assert triangle_area([], [], []) == -1
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1
    # Test for infinite value
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3)
