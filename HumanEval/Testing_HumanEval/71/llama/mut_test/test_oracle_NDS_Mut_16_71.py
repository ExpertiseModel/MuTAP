        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  To detect the mutation in the `triangle_area` function, you can add a test case that checks for a specific edge case scenario where the input values are slightly out of order. Here's an example of how you can modify the `test()` function to detect this change:
```python
def test():
    # Test with slightly out-of-order input values
    assert triangle_area(2, 3, 1) == -1
    # Test with slightly out-of-order input values
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
```
In this new test case, we pass slightly out-of-order input values to the `triangle_area` function, specifically `2, 3, 1` and `1, 2, 3`. The function should return `-1` in both cases, indicating that it's detecting the mutation.
By adding this test case, you can catch the change in the `triangle_area` function and ensure that your code is still working correctly.
