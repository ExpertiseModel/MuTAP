    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see. You want to add a test case to detect a potential mutation in the `triangle_area` function. Here's a new test case that would catch the mutation you mentioned:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a small positive number for a
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == 6.0
    # Test with a small negative number for b
    assert triangle_area(-1, 2, 3) == -6.0
    # Test with a large negative number for a
    assert triangle_area(1, -2, 3) == -6.0
    # Test with a large positive number for b
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, -3) == -6.0
```
This new test case adds an assert statement that checks if the function returns -6.0 for the following inputs:
* A small positive number for `a`
* A small negative number for `b`
* A large negative number for `a`
* A large positive number for `b`
By adding these test cases, the mutation you mentioned should now be
