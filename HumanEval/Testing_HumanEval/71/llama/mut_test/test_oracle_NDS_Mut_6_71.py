#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with empty lists
    assert triangle_area([], [], []) == -1
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1
 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test(), cannot detect the mutation in the following code snippet.
```python
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2    
    area = (((s * (s - a)) / (s - b)) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
    area = round(area, 2)
    return area

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] I understand, here is a new test case that can detect the mutation you mentioned:
```python
def test():
    # Test with small and medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangle
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == 49.0

    # Test with the mutated function
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) == -1
```
This test case will fail if the mutated function is called with 5 arguments, which is not a valid input for the function.
