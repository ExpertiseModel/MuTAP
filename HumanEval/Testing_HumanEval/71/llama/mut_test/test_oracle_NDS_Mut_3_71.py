    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. The previous test cases are not able to detect the mutation in the code snippet you provided because they are testing the incorrect parts of the function. Themutation is happening in the line `if (a + b <= c or a + c >= b or b + c <= a):`, where the `or` operator is being used to compare `a + b` to `c` instead of `a + b <= c`.
To detect this mutation, you can add a test case that specifically checks for this scenario:
```python
def test():
    # Test for the mutation in the "or" operator
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test for the correct behavior
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 10) == 10
```
This new test case will check if the function returns -1 when `a + b` is greater than `c`, which is the expected behavior for the mutated code.
