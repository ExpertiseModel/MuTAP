    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. The changes you made to the `triangle_area` function can be detected by modifying the test cases as follows:
```python
def test():
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with empty lists
    assert triangle_area([], [], []) == -1
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == 5.0
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == 31.25
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == 300.5

```
The new test case adds the following assertions:
* `assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1`: This test case checks that the function returns -1 when the heights are negative.
* `
