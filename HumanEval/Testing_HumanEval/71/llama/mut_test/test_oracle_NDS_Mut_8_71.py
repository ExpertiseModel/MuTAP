    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. The mutation you introduced is a subtle change in the way the area calculation is performed, specifically in the line `area = (((s * (s - a)) * (s - b)) ** (s - c)) ** 0.5`. The issue is that thearea calculation is now based on the floating-point arithmetic, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases.
To detect this change, we can add a test case that checks the area calculation using a more extreme set of inputs. Here's an example:
```python
# test case
def test():
    # Test with very large triangle sides
    assert triangle_area(100, 200, 300) == -1
    # Test with very small triangle sides
    assert triangle_area(0.1, 0.2, 0.3) == -1
```
This test case will check the area calculation for very large and very small triangle sides, which should detect any issues with the floating-point arithmetic.
