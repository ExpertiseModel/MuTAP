#Generate a new test case to detect this change.

    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. The mutated code added a new branch of the `if` statement, which is not detected by the previous test cases. To fix this, we can add a new test case that checks for the correct behavior of the mutated code. Here's an updated test suite:
```python
def test():
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with empty lists
    assert triangle_area([], [], []) == -1
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1

    # Test for the mutation
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3,) == 3.0
