#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Ah, I see the issue. The previous test cases are not detecting the mutation in the code because they are checking the same values for `a`, `b`, and `c` as the original function. To detect this mutation, we need to generate a test case that checks the function's behavior for different values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Here's an example of a new test case that should detect this mutation:
```python
# test case
def test():
    # Test with random values for a, b, and c
    a = random.randint(0, 10)
    b = random.randint(0, 10)
    c = random.randint(0, 10)
    # Mutated function call
    result = triangle_area(a, b, c)
    # Check if the result is -1
    assert result == -1
```
This test case will generate random values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, and then call the `triangle_area` function with those values. If the result is not -1, then the mutation has been detected.
