    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. The mutation you introduced in the modified `triangle_area` function is not detected by the test cases you provided. Here's a new test case that should detect this mutation:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a list of values that includes the mutation
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with a list of values that includes the mutation
    assert triangle_area([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]) == -1
```
The second test case in the `test` function tests the `triangle_area` function with a list of values that includes the mutation you introduced, namely a list with three values of [4, 5, 6]. The test case should fail and detect the mutation.
