        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2    
    area = (((s * (s - a)) * (s - b)) * (s + c)) ** 0.5

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  To detect the mutation in the `triangle_area` function, you can add a new test case that check for the correctness of the area calculation when the triangle is not right-angled. Here is an example of a new test case that can detect this mutation:
```python
# test case
def test():
    # Test with non-right-angled triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with non-right-angled triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 5) == -1
    # Test with non-right-angled triangles
    assert triangle_area(2, 3, 4) == -1
    ```
This new test case will check the correctness of the area calculation when the triangle is not right-angled, by giving it input values that are not equal to the sides of a right triangle. If the function returns the correct value of -1 in these cases, then it is likely that it is functioning correctly.
