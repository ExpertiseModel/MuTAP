#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  To detect the mutation in the `triangle_area` function caused by the change `b - c <= a` to `b - c <= a`, you can add a test case that tests for the specific edge case where `b - c` is greater than `a`. Here's an example of a new test case you can add to the `test` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles and b - c > a
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 40) == -1
```
This test case will check if the function returns -1 for the specific edge case where `b - c` is greater than `a`. If the function returns a different value, it will fail the test.
