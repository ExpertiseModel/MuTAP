    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. The mutation you added to the `triangle_area` function is a subtle change that can be difficult to detect with the test cases you provided earlier. Here's a new test case that should catch this mutation:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a small triangle
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with a medium triangle
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with a large triangle
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1
    # Test with a triangle containing a division by zero
    assert triangle_area(1, 0, 0) == -1
```
In this test case, we added a new test with a triangle containing a division by zero. This test case will ensure that the `triangle_area` function handles division by zero correctly, which is what the mutation you added was trying to exploit.
For example, when running `test()`, the first test with a small triangle will pass, but the second test with a triangle containing
