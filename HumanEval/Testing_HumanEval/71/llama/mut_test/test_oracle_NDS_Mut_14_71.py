```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  I understand, here's a new test case that can detect the mutation in the `triangle_area` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1
    # Test with a triangle where the sum of the three side lengths is equal to the square root of the sum of the three sides squared
    assert triangle_area(4, 8, 10) == -1
    # Test with a triangle where the sum of the three side lengths is greater than the square root of the sum of the three sides squared
    assert triangle_area(4, 8, 12) == -1
```
This new test case adds a test for a triangle where the sum of the three side lengths is equal to the square root of the sum of the three sides squared, which is the mutation
