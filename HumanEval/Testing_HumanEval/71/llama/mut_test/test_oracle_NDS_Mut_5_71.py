#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  To detect the mutation in the `triangle_area` function caused by the change in the if-else statement, we can add a test case that specifically checks for this scenario. Here's an example of how we can modify the `test` function to detect this mutation:
```python
# test case
def test():
    # Test case to detect the mutation in the if-else statement
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        # Create a triange with a+b > c
        triangle_area(3, 4, 5)
```
In this test case, we pass `triangle_area` a set of arguments (`3`, `4`, `5`) that create a triangle where `a + b > c`. We then call the function and assert that it raises a `ValueError`, which indicates that the mutation in the if-else statement has caused the function to return an incorrect value.
Note that this test case only detects the mutation in the if-else statement and does not check for any other potential issues that may have been introduced in the function. As with any testing strategy, it's important to ensure that your test cases cover
