``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1
    # Test with negative numbers

        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure, here's a new test case that can detect the mutation in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test with invalid inputs
    assert not triangle_area(1, 2, -3) == -1
    # Test with invalid inputs
    assert not triangle_area(-1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with small triangle
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with large triangle
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1
    # Test with triangle with different orders of sides
    assert triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == -1
    # Test with triangle with equal sides
    assert triangle_area(3, 3, 3) == -1
```
This test case will cover a wider range of inputs, including negative numbers, small and large triangles, triangles with different orders of sides, and triangles with equal sides. The `assert` statement will raise an error if the function returns anything other than `-1`, indicating that the input is invalid.
