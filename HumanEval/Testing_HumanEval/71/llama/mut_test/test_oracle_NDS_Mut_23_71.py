#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    # Test with empty lists

    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1 
    s = ((a + b) - c) / 2
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
    area = round(area, 2)

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python

def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. The previous test cases are detecting the correct behavior of the function, but they are not able to detect the mutation you introduced. Here's a new test case that should detect the mutation:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a small triangle
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with a medium triangle
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with a large triangle
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1
    # Test with a triangle that is not a rectangle
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 4) == -1
```
This new test case checks the function with a triangle that is not a rectangle, specifically a triangle with a side length of 4. In this case, the function should return -1, but the mutated function will return the area of the triangle instead.
