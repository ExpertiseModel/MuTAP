    assert [/INST] Sure! Here are some additional test cases that can detect the change in the `triangle_area()` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with empty lists
    assert triangle_area([], [], []) == -1
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1

    # Test with a triangle where a + b > c
    assert triangle_area(10, 15, 20) == -1

```
The new test cases are:

* Testing with a triangle where `a + b > c`. This will catch the change in the condition for when `a
