#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2

    return area


# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():

    if (a + b >= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a):
        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2    
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5

    assert [/INST] Sure, I can help you generate a new test case to detect the change in the `triangle_area` function. Here's an example:
```python
def test():
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with empty lists
    assert triangle_area([], [], []) == -1
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1

    # Test with a new case: a positive number greater than the sum of the other two numbers
    assert triangle_area(10, 5, 3) == 10

```
This new test case tests the function with a positive number greater than the sum of the other two
