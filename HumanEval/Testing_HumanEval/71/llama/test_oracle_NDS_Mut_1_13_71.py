#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2    
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
    area = round(area, 2)
    return area


# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with empty lists
    assert triangle_area([], [], []) == -1
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1
 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    
    if (a + b <= c or a - c <= b or b + c <= a):
        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2    
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
    area = round(area, 2)
    return area

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] To detect the change in the code snippet you provided, you can add a new test case that checks for the cases where the input values are not integers. Here's an example:
```python
def test():
    # Test with non-integer input values
    assert triangle_area(1.5, 2.5, 3.5) == -1
    # Test with negative input values
    assert triangle_area(-1.5, -2.5, -3.5) == -1
    # Test with zero input value
    assert triangle_area(0, 0, 0) == 0
```
This new test case will check for the cases where the input values are not integers, and will return -1 if the function fails to calculate the area correctly.
Alternatively, you could also add more test cases that check for other edge cases, such as inputs that are very large or very small, or inputs that are not well-formed (e.g. a plus b is negative).
