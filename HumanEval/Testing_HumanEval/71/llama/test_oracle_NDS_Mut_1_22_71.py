#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2

    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1
    # Test with negative numbers

    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2    
    area = (((s * (s - a)) * (s + b)) * (s - c)) ** 0.5

    return area

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  To detect the change in the code snippet you provided, you can generate a new test case that checks for the correctness of the area calculation when the triangle has a irregular shape. Here's an example of how you can modify the `test()` function to include this test case:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a triangle that has an irregular shape
    assert triangle_area(2, 3, 4) == -1
    # Test with a triangle that has a degenerate shape
    assert triangle_area(1, 0, 0) == -1
    # Test with a triangle that has a large perimeter
    assert triangle_area(2, 4, 6) == -1
    # Test with a triangle that has a small perimeter
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with a triangle that has a normal shape
    assert triangle_area(3, 4, 5) == 14.13966041396604
 ```
In this modified `test()` function, we added a new test case that checks the area
