#Generate a new test case to detect this change.

    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. The previous test cases are not able to detect the change in the function signature because they are only checking the value of `area`, but not the computation of `s`. To fix this, you can add additional test cases that check the intermediate computations in the function. Here are some new test cases that should detect the change in the function:
```python
def test():
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with empty lists
    assert triangle_area([], [], []) == -1
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1

    # Test the intermediate computations
    assert triangle_area(2,
