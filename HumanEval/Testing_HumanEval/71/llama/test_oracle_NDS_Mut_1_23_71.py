    assert [/INST]  Sure, I can help you generate a new test case to detect the change in the code snippet you provided.
Here is a new test case that you can add to your `test()` function:
```python
def test_edge_case():
    # Test with very small triangles
    assert triangle_area(0, 0, 0) == 0
    # Test with very large triangles
    assert triangle_area(100, 200, 300) == 0
    # Test with a triangle where a + b + c = 0
    assert triangle_area(0, 0, -1) == 0
    # Test with a triangle where a + b + c = 3*pi
    assert triangle_area(0, 0, 3 * math.pi) == 0
```
This new test case will test the edge cases of the `triangle_area()` function, including very small and very large triangles, as well as a triangle where the sum of the sides is equal to 0 or 3 * pi.
By adding this test case, you can ensure that your `test()` function is compreh
