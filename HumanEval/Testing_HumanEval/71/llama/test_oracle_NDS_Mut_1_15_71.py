        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python

def test():
    assert [/INST]  To detect the change in the code snippet you provided, you can add a test case that checks for the calculation of the area when `a + b > c` or `a + c > b`. Here's an example of how you can modify the `test()` function to include this test case:
```python
def test():
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with empty lists
    assert triangle_area([], [], []) == -1
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1

    # Test for correct calculation when a + b > c or a + c > b
    assert triangle_area(1, 2,
