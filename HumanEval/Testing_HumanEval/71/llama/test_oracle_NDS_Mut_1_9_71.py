#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:

    s = (a + b + c)/2    
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5

# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    # Test with negative numbers

    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with empty lists
    assert triangle_area([], [], []) == -1
    # Test with small triangles

    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1
 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1 
    s = ((a + b) + c) // 2
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
    area = round(area, 2)
    return area

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case

    assert [/INST] Sure, I can help you generate a new test case to detect the change in the code snippet you provided. Here is an updated test case:
```python
def test():
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1
    # Test with a triangle that is not a subset of the other two
    assert triangle_area(2, 3, 4) != -1
```
This new test case will test the function with small, medium, and large triangles, as well as a situation where one of the triangles is not a subset of the other two. By adding this test case, you can ensure that the function is working correctly even if the code is modified to use a different formula for calculating the area of the triangle.
