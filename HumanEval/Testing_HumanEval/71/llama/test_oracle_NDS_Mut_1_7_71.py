#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2    
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
    area = round(area, 2)
    return area


# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(-1, -2, -3) == -1
    # Test with negative numbers
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with empty lists
    assert triangle_area([], [], []) == -1
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1

```python
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    
    if (a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c < a):
        return -1 
    s = (a + b + c)/2    
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
    area = round(area, 2)
    return area

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  My apologies, you are correct. The test cases I generated earlier do not detect the change in the code snippet you provided. Here's a new test case that should detect the issue:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a large triangle
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with a small triangle
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with a triangle where a + b < c
    assert triangle_area(2, 3, 4) == -1
```
In this new test case, we added a new test with a large triangle (`a = 5`, `b = 10`, `c = 15`), a small triangle (`a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`), and a triangle where `a + b < c` (`a = 2`, `b = 3`, `c = 4`). These tests should catch the issue in the code whenever it's introduced.
