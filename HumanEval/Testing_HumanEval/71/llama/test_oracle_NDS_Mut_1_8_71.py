#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  My apologize for my previous response, and thank you for pointing that out. Here's a new test case that can detect the change in the code you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test with small triangles
    assert triangle_area(1, 2, 3) == -1
    # Test with medium triangles
    assert triangle_area(5, 10, 15) == -1
    # Test with large triangles
    assert triangle_area(10, 20, 30) == -1
    # Test with a triangle where the sum of two sides is greater than the third side
    assert triangle_area(2, 5, 7) == -1
```
In this new test case, we added a new test case that checks whether the function returns -1 when the sum of two sides is greater than the third side. This test case will detect the change in the code you provided, where the formula for calculating the area is changed to `(s * (s - a)) * (s - b)` instead of `s * (s - a) * (s - b)`.
