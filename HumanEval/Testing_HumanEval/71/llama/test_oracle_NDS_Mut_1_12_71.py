        return -1

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the problem. The previous test cases can't detect the change in the `triangle_area` function because they only test the basic inequality conditions, which haven't changed. To detect the issue with the new formula, you need to check that the return value is calculated correctly for a specific set of input values.
Here's a new test case that should detect the issue:
```python
def test():
    # Test with small triangle
    a = 1
    b = 2
    c = 3
    assert triangle_area(a, b, c) == -1
    # Test with medium triangle
    a = 5
    b = 10
    c = 15
    assert triangle_area(a, b, c) != -1
```
This test case will check that the function returns -1 for a small triangle with sides of 1, 2, and 3, and that it returns the correct value (which is not -1) for a medium triangle with sides of 5, 10, and 15.
Note that this new test case is more comprehensive and should catch most issues with the
