 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def compare(game,guess):
    
    return [abs(x-y) for x,y in zip(game,guess)]


# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure! Here are some test cases for the `compare` function:

```
def test():
    # Test with a simple game
    game = [1, 2, 3]
    guess = [2, 3, 4]
    result = compare(game, guess)
    assert result == [1, 1, 0]

    # Test with a more complex game
    game = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    guess = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    result = compare(game, guess)
    assert result == [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]

    # Test with different lengths
    game = [1, 2, 3]
    guess = [4, 5, 6]
    result = compare(game, guess)
    assert result == [1, 1, 0]

    # Test with invalid input
    game = [1, 2, 3]
    guess = [4, 5, 6, 7]
    result
