def compare(game,guess):
    """I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
    event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment are
    definitely worth noting down and comparing.
    Your task is to determine if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches.
    You are given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index shows a match. 
    Return an array of the same length denoting how far off each guess was. If they have guessed correctly,
    the value is 0, and if not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the score.
    
    
    example:

    compare([1,2,3,4,5,1],[1,2,3,4,2,-2]) -> [0,0,0,0,3,3]
    compare([0,5,0,0,0,4],[4,1,1,0,0,-2]) -> [4,4,1,0,0,6]

    assert [/INST]  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here is an example implementation of the `triangle` function using Python:
```
def triangle(x: int, y: int, z: int) -> str:
    if x == y == z:
        return "Equilateral triangle"
    elif x == y or y == z or x == z:
        return "Isosceles triangle"
    else:
        return "Scalene triangle"

# Example test cases
def test():
    assert triangle(2, 2, 2) == "Equilateral triangle"
    assert triangle(2, 2, 3) == "Isosceles triangle"
    assert triangle(2, 3, 4) == "Scalene triangle"

# Original code

def compare(game,guess):
    # Calculate the difference between the guess and each score
    differences = [abs(x-y) for x,y in zip(game,guess)]

    # Return an array of the differences
    return differences

# Example test cases

def test():
    # Create a game array
