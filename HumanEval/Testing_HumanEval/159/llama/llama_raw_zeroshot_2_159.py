 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    
    Variables:
    @number : integer
        the number of carrots that you have eaten.
    @need : integer
        the number of carrots that you need to eat.
    @remaining : integer
        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock
    
    Constrain:
    * 0 <= number <= 1000
    * 0 <= need <= 1000
    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000

    Have fun :)

    if(need <= remaining):
        return [ number + need , remaining-need ]
    else:
        return [ number + remaining , 0]


# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  To generate test cases for the `eat` function, we can use the `assert` statement in Python to check whether the function returns the expected results for different input combinations. Here are some test cases:
1. Test that the function returns the correct results for simple cases:
    ```python
    # Test case 1: Successful execution with small values
    assert eat(5, 6, 10) == [11, 4]
    # Test case 2: Successful execution with large values
    assert eat(10, 10, 10) == [10, 0]
    ```
2. Test that the function handles edge cases correctly:
    ```python
    # Test case 3: Negative number of carrots
    assert eat(-5, 6, 10) == [6, -5]
    # Test case 4: Negative remaining carrots
    assert eat(5, -6, 10) == [11, -6]
    ```
3. Test that the function handles cases where the need is greater than the remaining carrots:
    ```python
