 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def hex_key(num):
    
    primes = ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D')
    total = 0
    for i in range(0, len(num)):
        if num[i] in primes:
            total += 1
    return total

```

    assert hex_key(3) == 0
    # Test with non-primes
    assert hex_key(22) == 0
    # Test with a prime
    assert hex_key(7) == 1
    # Test with a large input
    assert hex_key(20) == 5

def test_empty_input():
    # Test with an empty input
    assert hex_key(None) == 0

def test_incorrect_input():
    # Test with an incorrect input

def test_primes_not_in_list():
