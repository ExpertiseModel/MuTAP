 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def solve(N):
    
    return bin(sum(int(i) for i in str(N)))[2:]


# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Of course! Here are some test cases for the `solve` function:
```python
def test():
    assert solve(1) == bin(1)[2:] == '0b1'
    assert solve(2) == bin(2)[2:] == '0b10'
    assert solve(3) == bin(3)[2:] == '0b110'
    assert solve(4) == bin(4)[2:] == '0b1100'
    assert solve(5) == bin(5)[2:] == '0b11000'
    raise RuntimeError("Too big to test")
# Add more test cases as needed
```
Let me explain each line:
1. `assert solve(1) == bin(1)[2:]` - This line checks that the function `solve` returns the expected value when passed the input `1`. The `bin()` function converts the integer `1` to a binary representation, and `[2:]` extracts the second half of the result (i.e., the binary digits).
2. `assert solve(2) == bin(2)[2:
