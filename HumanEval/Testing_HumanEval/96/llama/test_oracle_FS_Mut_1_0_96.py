    assert [/INST] Sure! Here's a new test case that can detect the change in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test that the function works correctly for small inputs
    assert count_up_to(1) == []
    assert count_up_to(2) == []
    assert count_up_to(3) == [2]
    assert count_up_to(4) == [2, 3]
    # Test that the function catches multiplications of previous primes
    assert count_up_to(5) == [2, 3]
    assert count_up_to(6) == [2, 3, 5]
    assert count_up_to(7) == [2, 3, 5, 7]
    # Test that the function works correctly for larger inputs
    assert count_up_to(100) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43,
