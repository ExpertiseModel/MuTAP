    assert [/INST] Sure! Here's a new test case that can detect the mutation in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Mutation: change the line `if i % j == 0:` to `if i % j != 0:`
    assert count_up_to(5) == [2, 3]
    assert count_up_to(10) == [2, 3, 5, 7]


    assert count_up_to(15) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

    # Mutation: change the line `if is_prime: ` to `if not is_prime:`
    assert count_up_to(5) == [2]
    assert count_up_to(10) == [2, 3]


    assert count_up_to(15) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

```
This new test case checks for the following mutations:
