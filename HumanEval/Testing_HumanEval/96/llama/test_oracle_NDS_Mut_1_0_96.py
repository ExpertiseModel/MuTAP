#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] I understand, here's a new test case that can detect the change in the code of `count_up_to()` function:
```python
def test():
    # Testing the original function
    assert count_up_to(5) == [2, 3]

    # Testing the modified function
    assert count_up_to(10) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

    # Testing both functions with a large input
    assert count_up_to(20) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
```
Explanation:
The new test case `test()` includes three tests:
1. Testing the original function `count_up_to(5)` with the expected output `[2, 3]`.
2. Testing the modified function `count_up_to(10)` with the expected output `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]`.
3. Testing both functions with a large input `
