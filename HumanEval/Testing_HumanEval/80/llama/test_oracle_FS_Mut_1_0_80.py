    for i in range(len(s) - 2):

        return False
    return True

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure! Here's a new test case that should detect the change in the `is_happy` function:
```python
def test():
    assert is_happy("thequickbrownfoxjumpedoverthelazydog") == True
    # Add a new test case to check for the edge case where the


    assert is_happy("This is a happy string") == False




```
In this new test case, we're adding a test for a string that has a single repeated character in the middle. This should cause the function to return `False` because the repeated character is not adjacent to the same character on either side.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
