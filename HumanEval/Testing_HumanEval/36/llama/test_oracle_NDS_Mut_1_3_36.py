#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    
    ns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            ns.append(i)
    s = ''.join(list(map(str, ns)))
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        ans += (c == '7')
    return ans




# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    # Test case 1: Negative number of inputs
    assert fizz_buzz(-1) == 0

    # Test case 2: Negative number of inputs
    assert fizz_buzz(-2) == 0

    # Test case 1: Fizz input
 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    
    ns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 != 0):
            ns.append(i)
    s = ''.join(list(map(str, ns)))
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        ans += (c == '7')
    return ans



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure! Here's a new test case that will detect the change in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test case 1: Fizz input with odd number of inputs
    assert fizz_buzz(3) == 3

    # Test case 2: Fizz input with even number of inputs
    assert fizz_buzz(4) == 2

    # Test case 3: Fizz input with a mix of odd and even number of inputs
    assert fizz_buzz(5) == 3


```
In this test case, we're adding a new test case that checks the output when the input is an odd number of inputs. In the original code, the output for `fizz_buzz(3)` would still be `0`, but the new test case will ensure that the output is `3`, which is the correct result.
Also, note that we're using `list`to convert the `ns` list to a list of integers, so that we can use the `in` operator to check if the `c` element in the `s` list is equal to `'7'
