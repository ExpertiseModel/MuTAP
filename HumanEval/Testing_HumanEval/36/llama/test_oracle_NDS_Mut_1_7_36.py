#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    
    ns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            ns.append(i)
    s = ''.join(list(map(str, ns)))
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        ans += (c == '7')
    return ans




# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    # Test case 1: Negative number of inputs
    assert fizz_buzz(-1) == 0

    # Test case 2: Negative number of inputs
    assert fizz_buzz(-2) == 0

    # Test case 1: Fizz input
 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    
    ns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            ns.append(i)
    s = ''.join(list(map(str, ns)))
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        ans -= c == '7'
    return ans



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure! Here's a new test case that can detect the change in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test case 3: Changed logic for Fizz output
    assert fizz_buzz(5) == 5
    # Test case 4: Changed logic for Buzz output
    assert fizz_buzz(13) == 10
    # Test case 5: Test the new output logic
    assert fizz_buzz(7) == 7


```
The new test cases added are:

* Test case 3: Check that the Fizz output is correct when the input is 5.
* Test case 4: Check that the Buzz output is correct when the input is 13.
* Test case 5: Check that the new output logic works correctly for the input 7.
These test cases cover the changed logic in the function and ensure that the function is working correctly with the new output logic.
