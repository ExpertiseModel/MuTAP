#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    
    ns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:

def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    
    ns = []
    for i in range(n):

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] I can certainly help you generate a new test case to detect the change in the code snippet you provided. Here is an example of how you could do this:
```python
def test():
    # Test case 3: Fizzbuzz with multiple sequences
    assert fizz_buzz(5) == 7

    # Test case 4: Fizzbuzz with a sequence containing 11 and 13
    assert fizz_buzz(11) == 5

    # Test case 5: Fizzbuzz with a sequence containing 11 and 13, and a non-7 character in the middle
    assert fizz_buzz(12) == 2

```
In this new test case, we are testing the `fizz_buzz` function with multiple input sequences, including one that contains both `11` and `13`, as well as a non-`7` character in the middle. We are then verifying that the function returns the correct output for each of these inputs.
By adding these new test cases to your existing test suite, you can increase the coverage and robustness of your tests, and catch
