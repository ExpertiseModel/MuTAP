#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    
    ns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            ns.append(i)
    s = ''.join(list(map(str, ns)))
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        ans += (c == '7')
    return ans




# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    # Test case 1: Negative number of inputs
    assert fizz_buzz(-1) == 0

    # Test case 2: Negative number of inputs
    assert fizz_buzz(-2) == 0

    # Test case 1: Fizz input
 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    
    ns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i * 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0):
            ns.append(i)
    s = ''.join(list(map(str, ns)))
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        ans += (c == '7')
    return ans



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure! Here's a new test case that can detect the change in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test case 3: Changed condition for Fizz input
    assert fizz_buzz(5) == 5
    # Test case 4: Changed condition for Buzz input
    assert fizz_buzz(10) == 5
    # Test case 5: Both conditions changed
    assert fizz_buzz(7) == 3
```
The above test cases will fail when the conditions for the Fizz and Buzz inputs are changed, as in the new code snippet you provided.
