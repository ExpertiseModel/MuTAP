#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    assert fizz_buzz(-2) == 0

    # Test case 1: Fizz input

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    
    ns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if not ((i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0)):
            ns.append(i)

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure! Here's a new test case that can detect the mutation in the `fizz_buzz` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test case 3: Added condition to check for '7' in the output
    # Add a new input and assert that the output is 0
    assert fizz_buzz(5) == 0
```
This test case will run the `fizz_buzz` function with an input `n` of 5, and check that the output is 0, which is the correct result when there are no '7's in the output.
The `assert` statement in the `test()` function will fail if the output of the `fizz_buzz` function is not 0, which will indicate that there is a mutation in the `fizz_buzz` function.
