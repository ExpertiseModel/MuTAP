#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    ns = []

    ns = []

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python

def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure! To detect the mutation in the `fizz_buzz` function where the condition `c != '7'` is changed to `c != 'FX'`, you can add a new test case that specifically checks for this mutation. Here's an example of how you can modify the `test` function to include this new test case:
```python
def test():
    # Test case 1: Negative number of inputs
    assert fizz_buzz(-1) == 0

    # Test case 2: Negative number of inputs
    assert fizz_buzz(-2) == 0

    # Test case 3: Mutation detection (FX instead of 7)
    assert fizz_buzz(5) == 5

    def assert_mutation(ans):
        assert ans == 4, "Expected answer is 4, but actual answer is {}}".format(ans)
    assert_mutation(fizz_buzz(5))


```
In this example, the new test case `Test case 3: Mutation detection (FX instead of 7)` is added after the existing
