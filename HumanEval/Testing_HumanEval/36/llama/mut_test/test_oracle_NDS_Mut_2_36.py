#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    
    ns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:

    # Test case 1: Negative number of inputs
    assert fizz_buzz(-1) == 0

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    
    ns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i % 11 != 0 or i % 13 == 0):
            ns.append(i)
    s = ''.join(list(map(str, ns)))

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  To detect the mutation in the code snippet you provided, you can add a new test case that checks if the returned value of `fizz_buzz()` is the same as the original value. Here's an example of how you can do this:
```python
# test case
def test():
    # Original value
    assert fizz_buzz(5) == 5

    # Mutated value
    mutated_val = fizz_buzz(5)
    # Check if the values are different
    assert mutated_val != fizz_buzz(5)

```
This new test case will check if the value returned by `fizz_buzz(5)` is the same as the original value. If the values are different, it means that the mutation has occurred and the test case will fail.
