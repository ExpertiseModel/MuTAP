#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    
    ns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:

    assert fizz_buzz(-2) == 0

    # Test case 1: Fizz input

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    
    ns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            ns.append(i)
    s = ''.join(list(map(str, ns)))
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        ans -= c == '7'
    return ans



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Certainly! To detect the change in the `fizz_buzz` function that you introduced, you can create a new test case that checks the result of the function for the mutated code. Here's an example of how you can do that:
```python
def test():
    # Test case 3: Mutated function output
    assert fizz_buzz(5) != 0

    # Test case 4: Mutated function output with a different number of '7's
    assert fizz_buzz(5) == 2

# Run the test suite
import unittest
suite = unittest.TestSuite()
suite.addTest(test())



sys.exit(unittest.main())
```
In this new test case, we're using the `assert` statement to check the result of the `fizz_buzz` function. We're passing the value `5` as the argument to the function, and then checking the result for equality with `0`. If the mutated function outputs `0`, the test will fail and indicate that the test case has failed.
We're also adding a second
