#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  To detect the mutation in the code snippet you provided, you can add another test case to check if the result of the `fizz_buzz()` function is changed when the `or` statement in the condition of the `ns.append()` line is replaced with `or` instead of `||`. Here's an example of how you can modify the `test()` function to detect this mutation:
```python
def test():
    # Test case 3: Changed or operator in append statement
    # Mutation: Replace "or" with "||" in the append statement
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        fizz_buzz(5)
```

In this test case, we are simulating a mutation in the `fizz_buzz()` function by replacing the `or` operator in the append statement with `||`. This will raise a `ValueError` because `ns.append()` expects a boolean value as its second argument, but `||` evaluates to a boolean value only when both operands are true, so it will not work in this context.
By adding this test case, you can ensure that the `fizz_buzz
