#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def double_the_difference(lst):
    
    return sum([i**2 for i in lst if i > 0 and i%2!=0 and "." not in str(i)])


# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    # Simple list with odd numbers
    assert double_the_difference([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) == 165


    # Empty list
    assert double_the_difference([]) == 0

    # List with even numbers
    assert double_the_difference([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) == 0

    # List with decimals
    assert double_the_difference([1.5, 3.7, 0.5, 2.1, 4.3]) == 0
 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    
   return sum([i ** 2 for i in lst if (i >= 0 and i % 2 != 0 and '.' not in str(i))])

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Ah, I see! In that case, here's a new test case that should detect the change in the function:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a list of odd numbers and a decimal number
    lst = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1.5]
    assert double_the_difference([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1.5]) == 165


    # Test with a list of even numbers and a decimal number
    lst = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 0.5]
    assert double_the_difference([2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 0.5]) == 0


    # Test with a list containing a decimal number only
    lst = [1.5]
    assert double_the_difference([1.5]) == 1.5 ** 2
```
This new test case should pass for the original function, and fail for the modified function, since the modified function returns the square of the values in the list, whereas the original function returns the sum of the squares of the values in the list.
