# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure! Here are some test cases for the `double_the_difference` function:
1. Test with a list of positive integers:
```python
assert double_the_difference([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30
```
2. Test with a list of negative integers:
```python
assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, -3, -4]) == -1 + -4 + 9 + 16 = -26
```
3. Test with a list of mixed integers and non-integers:
```python
assert double_the_difference([1, 2, 3, 4, -5]) == 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 71
```
4. Test with an empty list:
```python
assert double_the_difference([]) == 0
```
5. Test with a list containing floating-point numbers:

```python
assert double_the_difference([1.1, 2.2, 3
