 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[3 * i:min((3 * i) + 3, len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) * 3)]

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] I understand, here are some additional test cases that can detect the change in the `encode_cyclic` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a long string
    assert encode_cyclic("the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog") == "btehfpxjpgmtzoverladzgf"

    # Test with a string that is not divisible by 3
    assert encode_cyclic("apple") == "aaplpe"

    # Test with a string that contains repeated characters
    assert encode_cyclic("aaabaaa") == "baabaaab"

    # Test with a string that contains special characters
    assert encode_cyclic("hello world!") == "hllowrld!"


```
These additional test cases cover more edge cases and are more comprehensive in detecting changes in the `encode_cyclic` function.
