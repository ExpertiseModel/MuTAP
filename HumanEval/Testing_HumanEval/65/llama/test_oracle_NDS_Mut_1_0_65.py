#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def circular_shift(x, shift):
    
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s):
        return s[::-1]
    else:
        return s[len(s) - shift:] + s[:len(s) - shift]


# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    # Test 1: Positive shift
    assert circular_shift("Hello World!", 3) == "ld!Hello Wor"

    # Test 2: Negative shift
    assert circular_shift("Hello World!", -3) == "Hello World!"

    # Test 3: Shift exceeds length of input string
    assert circular_shift("Hello World!", 5)


 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    
    s = str(x)
    if shift > len(s):
       return s[::1]
    else:
        return s[len(s) - shift:] + s[:len(s) - shift]

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Ah, I see the issue now. The previous test cases were only checking the overall rotation of the string, but not the exact changes in the resulting string. Here's a new test case that should detect the changed code:
```python
def test():
    # Test 4: Shift exceeds length of input string and returns modified string
    assert circular_shift("Hello World!", 5) == "Loewr Hlro Wd!!"

```
In this test case, we pass a longer input string than the earlier test cases, and also check the modified string returned by the function. This should catch any modifications made to the string due to the changed code.
