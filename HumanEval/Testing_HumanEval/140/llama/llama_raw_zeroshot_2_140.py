 Generate test cases for the following function:

# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure, here are some test cases for the `fix_spaces` function:
1. `fix_spaces("Example") == "Example"`: This test case should pass, as the function should not change the original string.
2. `fix_spaces("Example 1") == "Example_1"`: This test case should pass, as the function should replace consecutive spaces with underscores.
3. `fix_spaces(" Example 2") == "_Example_2"`: This test case should pass, as the function should replace the leading space with an underscore and the trailing space with a hyphen.
4. `fix_spaces(" Example   3") == "_Example-3"`: This test case should pass, as the function should replace consecutive spaces with underscores and hyphens.
5. `fix_spaces("foobar") == "fooba_r"`: This test case should fail, as the function should not change the original string.
6. `fix_spaces("   foo   ") == "_foo_"`: This test case should pass, as the function should replace consecutive spaces with underscores.
7. `fix_spaces("foobar  baz")
