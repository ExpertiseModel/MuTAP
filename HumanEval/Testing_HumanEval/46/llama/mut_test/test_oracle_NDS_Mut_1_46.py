```python
# test case
def test():
    # Mutation: Increased the size of the results list
    assert fib4(5) != fib4.func.call(5)

    # Mutation: Increased the value of the results list at index 0
    assert fib4(10) != fib4.func.call(10)

    # Mutation: Changed the value of the results list at index 0
    assert fib4(15) != fib4.func.call(15)

# Test the mutation
def test_mutation():
    # Create a new list with the same items as the original list, but with a different index 0 value
    mutated_results = [0, 2, 0, 0]
    # Call the function with the mutated results list
    assert fib4(10) != fib4.func.call(mutated_results)

```
This new test case checks if the `fib
