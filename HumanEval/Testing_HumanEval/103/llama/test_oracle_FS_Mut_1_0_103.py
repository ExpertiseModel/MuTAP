    assert [/INST] Ah, I see the issue. The previous test cases were relying on the fact that the function was using the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the numbers, but the updated code is using the `//` (integer division) operator to calculate the division of the `summation` variable by the divisor (`(m - n) + 1`).
To detect this change, you can add a test case that checks the behavior of the function when the divisor is not an integer. Here's an example of how you can modify the `test` function to include this test case:
```python
def test():
    # Test that the function works correctly when the divisor is not an integer
    assert rounded_avg(3, 2) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(5, 3) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(7, 4) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(10, 5) == -1

    # Test that the function raises an error when the divisor is not an integer
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        rounded_avg(3,
