#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def rounded_avg(n, m):
    
    if m < n:
        return -1
    summation = 0
    for i in range(n, m+1):
        summation += i
    return bin(round(summation/(m - n + 1)))

 def test():
    
    assert rounded_avg(3, 2) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(5, 3) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(7, 4) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(10, 5) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(12, 6) == -1

 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):

    summation = 0
    for i in range(n, m+1):
        summation += i
    return bin(round(summation / ((m - n) - 1)))

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] ```python
def test():
    assert rounded_avg(3, 2) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(5, 3) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(7, 4) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(10, 5) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(12, 6) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(15, 7) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(18, 8) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(20, 9) == -1
    assert rounded_avg(3, 2) == -1
```
The new test case will detect the change in the function signature, specifically the addition of a new parameter `()` in the function signature. The `assert` statement will fail if the function returns a non-zero value for the given input parameters.
