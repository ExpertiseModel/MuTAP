 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """
    return [n + 2*i for i in range(n)]


# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure! Here are some test cases for the `make_a_pile` function:
```
test_cases = [
    # Test for valid input
    assert make_a_pile(3) == [3, 5, 7], "Failed to create pile of 3 levels with 3, 5, and 7 stones"
    # Test for odd input
    assert make_a_pile(5) == [5, 7, 9], "Failed to create pile of 5 levels with 5, 7, and 9 stones"
    # Test for even input
    assert make_a_pile(5) == [4, 6, 8], "Failed to create pile of 5 levels with 4, 6, and 8 stones"
    # Test for edge cases
    assert make_a_pile(1) == [2], "Failed to create pile of 1 level with 2 stones"
    assert make_a_pile(0) == [], "Failed to create pile of 0 levels with 0 stones"
]
