#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def solution(lst):
    
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx%2==0 and x%2==1])




#<test>

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert solution([]) == 0
    assert solution([1]) == 1
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == 9
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) == 16
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]) == 16
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) == 25

    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) == 25
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 25
 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def solution(lst):
    
   return sum([x for (idx, x) in enumerate(lst) if (idx % 2 == 0 or x % 2 == 1)])

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Ah, I see! In that case, here's a new test case that should detect the change in the `solution` function:
```python
def test():
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == 15
```
The idea behind this test case is to pass a list of numbers that has an odd number of elements, and check that the `solution` function returns the correct value. In this case, the list has 5 elements, and the `solution` function should return 15 (the sum of the even numbered elements).
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
