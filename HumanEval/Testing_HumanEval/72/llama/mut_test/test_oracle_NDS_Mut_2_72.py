    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. The previous test cases only check the overall logic of the `will_it_fly` function, but not the specific mutation you introduced in the updated code snippet. Here's a new test case that should detect the mutation:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a list of integers that has a different element than the original list
    q = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    w = 4
    # Mutate the list by changing one of the elements
    q[0] = 6
    assert will_it_fly(q[2, 1, 3, 4, 5], 4) is False

    # Test with a list of integers that has a different length than the original list
    q = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    w = 5
    # Add an extra element to the list
    q.append(6)
    assert will_it_fly(q, w) is False

    # Test with a list of integers that has a different order than the original list
    q = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
