#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure! Here is a new test case that can detect the change in the `will_it_fly` function:
```python
def test():
    assert will_it_fly([3, 4, 5, 2, 5, 4], 15) != will_it_fly([3, 4, 5, 2, 5, 4], 10)
```
Explanation:
The change in the function is that the `not` operator is removed from the condition in the while loop. This means that the function will now continue to check the elements of the `q` list until they are duplicates, instead of stopping as soon as the first mismatch is found.
This new test case checks if the function returns the same result when passed two different input lists with different lengths. If the function returns `True` for the first input list and `False` for the second input list, then it indicates that the function has changed and will no longer detect duplicates in the list as soon as the first mismatch is found.
