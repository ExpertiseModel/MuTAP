 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def will_it_fly(q,w):
   
    if sum(q) > w:
        return False

    i, j = 0, len(q)-1
    while i<j:
        if q[i] != q[j]:
            return False
        i+=1
        j-=1
    return True


# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Great! I can definitely help you generate test cases for the `will_it_fly` function. Here are some test cases you can use:
1. Test that the function correctly returns `False` when the sum of the query is less than or equal to the weight:
```python
def test_sum_less_than_weight():
    q = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    w = 5
    assert will_it_fly(q, w) is False
```
1. Test that the function correctly returns `True` when the query is sorted and the sum is greater than the weight:
```python
def test_sorted_sum_greater_than_weight():
    q = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    w = 5
    assert will_it_fly(q, w) is True
```
1. Test that the function correctly returns `True` when the query is sorted and the sum is greater than the weight, but the query contains duplicates:
```python
def test_sorted_sum_greater_than_weight_with_duplicates():
    q
