#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    # Test case 1: Valid string
    assert solve("hello") == "HELLO"
    # Test case 2: Uppercase to lowercase
    assert solve("HELLO") == "hello"
    # Test case 3: Lowercase to uppercase
    assert solve("hello") == "HELLO"
    # Test case 4: Number
    assert solve("1234") == "4321"
    # Test case 5: Special characters
    assert solve("#a@C") == "#A@c"
    # Test case 6: Empty string
    assert solve("") == ""

 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def solve(s):
    
    flg = 0
    idx = 0
    new_str = list(s)
    for i in s:
        if i.isalpha():
            new_str[idx] = i.swapcase()
            flg = 1
        idx += 1
    s = ""
    for i in new_str:
        s += i
    if flg == 0:
        return s[::-1]
    return s

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure! Here's a new test case to detect the change in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test case 7: Uppercase to lowercase with special characters
    assert solve("HELLO#a@C") == "#a@c"

```
In this test case, we're passing the string "HELLO#a@C" to the `solve()` function, which contains both uppercase and special characters. The function should return the transformed string "#a@c".
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
