 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def solve(s):
    
    flg = 0
    idx = 0
    new_str = list(s)
    for i in s:
        if i.isalpha():
            new_str[idx] = i.swapcase()
            flg = 1
        idx += 1
    s = ""
    for i in new_str:
        s += i
    if flg == 0:
        return s[len(s)::-1]
    return s


# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure, here are some test cases for the `solve` function:
```
def test():
    # Test with a string that only contains lowercase letters
    s = "hello"
    assert solve(s) == "HELLO"
    # Test with a string that contains uppercase letters
    s = "HELLO WORLD"
    assert solve(s) == "helloWorld"
    # Test with a string that contains special characters
    s = "hello_world!!"
    assert solve(s) == "helloWorld!"

# Test with an empty string
s = ""
assert solve(s) == ""

# Test with a string that is too long
s = "a" * 100
assert solve(s) == ""
```
Here is how you can use these test cases in your code:
```
# Run the test cases
for tc in test():
    print(tc)
```
I hope these test cases are helpful. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
