 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def add_elements(arr, k):
    
    return sum(elem for elem in arr[:k] if len(str(elem)) <= 2)


# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure! Here are some test cases for the `add_elements` function:

```
def test():
    # Basic case
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    k = 2
    result = add_elements(arr, k)
    assert result == 7

    # Empty list
    arr = []
    k = 2
    result = add_elements(arr, k)
    assert result == 0

    # Outside range
    arr = [1, 2, 3]
    k = 5
    result = add_elements(arr, k)
    assert result == 0
```
Explanation:

* In the first test case, `arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k` is `2`. The function returns `7`, which is the sum of the first 2 elements of `arr`.
* In the second test case, `arr` is an empty list (`[]`) and `k` is `2`. The function returns `0`, which is the expected result since
