#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True

    return False




# test case
import unittest

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    #test_negative_operations
   assert below_zero([1, -2, -3, 4, -5]) is True
   #test_positive_operations
   assert below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) is False
   #test_zero_operations
   assert below_zero([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) is False


 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test(), cannot detect the mutation in the following code snippet.
```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance -= op

    return False



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure, here's a new test case that can detect the mutation in the `below_zero` function:
```python
def test():
    # test mutated function
    assert not below_zero([1, -2, -3, 4, 5])

    # test original function
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) is False


```
In this test case, we added a new test function `test` that calls the original `below_zero` function and verifies that it returns `False`. We also added a new test case that calls the mutated `below_zero` function and verifies that it returns `True`.
By adding this additional test case, we can detect the mutation in the `below_zero` function and make sure that the tests are still passing.
