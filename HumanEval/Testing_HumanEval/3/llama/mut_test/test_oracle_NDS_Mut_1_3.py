#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True

    return False

 def test():
    
    #test_negative_operations
   assert below_zero([1, -2, -3, 4, -5]) is True
   #test_positive_operations
   assert below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) is False

   assert below_zero([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) is False

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. The previous test cases were only checking for the correct behavior when the list of operations is negative, but they did not account for the changed logic in the modified version of the `below_zero` function. Here's a new test case that should detect the mutation:
```python
def test():
    # test positive operations
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) is False
    # test negative operations with changed logic
    assert below_zero([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]) is False
    # test positive operations with changed logic
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, -5]) is True

```
This new test case will check the functionality of the function with both positive and negative operations, and it will also check the modified logic for negative operations.
