#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True

    return False




# test case
import unittest

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    #test_negative_operations
   assert below_zero([1, -2, -3, 4, -5]) is True
   #test_positive_operations
   assert below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) is False
   #test_zero_operations
   assert below_zero([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) is False


 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test(), cannot detect the mutation in the following code snippet.
```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
  
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if not (balance < 0):
            return True

    return False



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure, here's a new test case that can detect the mutation in the `below_zero` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test with positive operations
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) is False
    # Test with negative operations
    assert below_zero([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]) is True
    # Test with zero operations
    assert below_zero([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) is False
    # Test with mutated function
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], balance=5) is True
```
In this new test case, we added a new test with a `balance` parameter equal to `5`, which will cause the mutated `below_zero` function to return `True`. This test will help detect the mutation in the function.
