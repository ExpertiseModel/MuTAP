#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True

    return False




# test case
import unittest

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    #test_negative_operations
   assert below_zero([1, -2, -3, 4, -5]) is True
   #test_positive_operations
   assert below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) is False
   #test_zero_operations
   assert below_zero([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) is False


 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance <= 0:
            return True

    return False





```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure! Here's a new test case to detect the change in the `below_zero` function:
```python
def test():
    # test with a negative list
    assert below_zero([-1, -2, -3]) is True
    # test with a positive list
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) is False
    # test with a zero list
    assert below_zero([0, 0, 0]) is False

```
This new test case checks the function's behavior when the input list is negative, positive, or zero. By changing the input list, we can test the function's behavior in different scenarios and ensure that it works correctly.
