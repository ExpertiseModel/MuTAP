#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True

    return False







``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False    
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:

    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance > 0:
            return True

    return False





```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see! Thank you for pointing that out. Here's a new test case that should detect the change in the `below_zero()` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test with positive balance
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False

    # Test with negative balance
    assert below_zero([-1, -2, -3]) == True
    # Test with a mixed balance
    assert below_zero([1, -2, 3, -4]) == False


```
This new test case will check the function's behavior with both positive and negative balances, and also with a mixed balance. By adding these additional test cases, we can have more comprehensive coverage of the function's behavior and catch any potential issues.
