#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True

    return False







``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False    
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance -= op
        if balance < 0:
            return True

    return False



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. The previous test cases were not able to detect the change in the `below_zero` function because they were only checking the balance against zero, without considering the sign of the balance.
To detect the change in the function, we can add a new test case that checks the sign of the balance after each operation is applied. Here's the updated test case:
```python
def test():
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
    # Add a new test case to check the sign of the balance
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3, -4]) == False
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4]) == True

```
This new test case will make sure that the function behaves correctly when the operations are non-negative, and will fail when the operations are negative.
