#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True

    return False







``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False    
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
  
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if not (balance < 0):
            return True

    return False



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see! The change you're referring to is the addition of the `not` keyword in the conditional statement. Here's a new test case that should detect this change:
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 4, 5]) == True
    # Add a new test case to detect the change in the conditional statement
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == False

```
This new test case will ensure that the function returns `True` when the balance is greater than or equal to 0, and `False` otherwise.
