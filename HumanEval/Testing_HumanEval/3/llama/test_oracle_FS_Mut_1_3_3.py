#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True

    return False







``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3]) == False    
    assert below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]) == True ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance <= 0:
            return True

    return False





```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Understood! Here's a new test case to detect the change in the `below_zero` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test passed for negative numbers
    assert below_zero([-1, 2, -4, 5]) == True
    # Test failed for negative numbers
    assert below_zero([-1, 2, 3, -4, 5]) == False
```
In this test case, we are testing the `below_zero` function with two different lists of integers: one where all the numbers are negative, and one where there are both positive and negative numbers.
For the first list, we expect the function to return `True`, as all the numbers are less than or equal to zero.
For the second list, we expect the function to return `False`, as there are both positive and negative numbers, and the balance is not less than or equal to zero.
This test case should detect the change in the `below_zero` function caused by the addition of the `if balance <= 0:` statement.
