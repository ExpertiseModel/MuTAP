#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True

    return False




# test case
import unittest

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    #test_negative_operations
   assert below_zero([1, -2, -3, 4, -5]) is True
   #test_positive_operations
   assert below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) is False
   #test_zero_operations
   assert below_zero([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) is False


 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
from typing import List


def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
  
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if not (balance < 0):
            return True

    return False



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure! Here's a new test case to detect the change in the code:
```python
def test():
    # test the new implementation with positive operands
    assert below_zero([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) is False
    # test the new implementation with negative operands
    assert below_zero([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]) is True

```
This test case checks the new implementation of the `below_zero` function with both positive and negative operands, and asserts that the correct result is returned.
