 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def select_words(s, n):
    
    result = []
    for word in s.split():
        n_consonants = 0
        for i in range(0, len(word)):
            if word[i].lower() not in ["a","e","i","o","u"]:
                n_consonants += 1 
        if n_consonants == n:
            result.append(word)
    return result



# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure! Here are some test cases for the `select_words` function:
```
# Test 1: Valid input
s = "Hello World!"
n = 2
expected_result = ["H", "W"]
actual_result = select_words(s, n)
assert actual_result == expected_result

# Test 2: Valid input with multiple words
s = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
n = 3
expected_result = ["The", "brown", "dog"]
actual_result = select_words(s, n)
assert actual_result == expected_result

# Test 3: Invalid input
s = "This is not a valid sentence."
n = 4
expected_result = []
actual_result = select_words(s, n)
assert actual_result == expected_result

# Test 4: Valid input with too many consonants
s = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
n = 5
expected_result = ["The", "brown", "dog"]
actual_result = select_words(s
