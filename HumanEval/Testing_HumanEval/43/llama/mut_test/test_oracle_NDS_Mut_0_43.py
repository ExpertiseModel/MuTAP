def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see. You're asking me to generate a new test case to detect the mutation in the `pairs_sum_to_zero` function, which has been modified to include a new `range` loop that starts from the previous index instead of the begining of the list. Here's a new test case that covers this scenario:
```python
def test():
    # Test that the function returns False when a pair of numbers sum to 0, and the index of the second number is less than the index of the first number
    # Create a list of integers that sum to 0, and verify that the function returns False
    l = [7, 1, 2, -3]
    assert pairs_sum_to_zero([7, 1, 2, -3]) == False
```
This new test case creates a list `l` with integers that sum to 0, and then calls the `pairs_sum_to_zero` function to verify that it returns False. The catch is that the list `l` is ordered in a way that the second number in the pair (i.e., `-3`) is less than the index of the first number (`1`). This is the
