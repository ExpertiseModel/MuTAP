#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python

def test():
    assert [/INST] I understand. Here is a new test case that can detect the mutation in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a modified file name that contains illegal characters
    assert file_name_check("example.txt\0abc") == "No", "File name should not contain illegal characters"
    # Test with a modified file name that has an extra extension
    assert file_name_check("example.txtabc") == "No", "File name should not have extra extensions"
    # Test with a modified file name that has an illegal suffix
    assert file_name_check("example.txtabc.dz") == "No", "File name should not have illegal suffix"
```
This new test case adds three more test cases to cover the following mutations:
1. A file name that contains illegal characters (e.g. "example.txt\0abc")
2. A file name that has an extra extension (e.g. "example.txtabc")
3. A file name that has an illegal suffix (e.g. "example.txtabc.dz")
By adding these additional test cases, you can ensure that the
