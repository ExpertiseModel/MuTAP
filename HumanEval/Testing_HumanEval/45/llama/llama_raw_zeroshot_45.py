 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def triangle_area(a, h):
    
    return a * h / 2.0




# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Of course! Here are some test cases for the `triangle_area` function:
```Python
def test():
    # Test with valid inputs
    assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 5 * 3 / 2 == 13.5
    assert triangle_area(10, 5) == 10 * 5 / 2 == 75
    # Test with invalid input
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        triangle_area(1, 2)
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        triangle_area("hello", 2)
```
Let me explain what each test case is doing:
1. `assert triangle_area(5, 3) == 13.5`: This test case calls the `triangle_area` function with `a=5` and `h=3`, and asserts that the result is `13.5`, which is the expected value.
2. `assert triangle_area(10, 5) == 75`: This test case calls the `triangle_area` function with `a=10` and `
