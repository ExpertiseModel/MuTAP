#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    ret = set()
    for e1 in l1:
        for e2 in l2:
            if e1 == e2:

    # Test with empty lists
    assert common([], []) == []
    assert common([], [1, 2, 3]) == []
    # Test with different lengths
    assert common([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]) == [2, 3]
    assert common([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) == []

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.

    assert [/INST] Ah, I see the issue now. The previous test cases were only checking for the correctness of the return value, but not checking for any changes in the functionality of the code. Here's a new test case that should detect the modification you made to the `common` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a list of integers greater than another list
    assert common([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) != common([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
    # Test with a list of integers less than another list
    assert common([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) != common([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])
    # Test with a list of integers equal to another list
    assert common([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]) == common([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])

```
This new test case checks for the following cases:

* A list of integers greater than another list:
