#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    
    return n%2 == 0 and n >= 8


#</code>
#<test>

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True

    assert is_equal_to_sum_even(7) == False

    assert is_equal_to_sum_even(7) == False

 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    
   return (n % 2 == 0 or n >= 8)

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Ah, I see! In that case, you can add a new test case to detect the change in the `is_equal_to_sum_even` function as follows:
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
```
This new test case will check if the function returns `True` when passed the value `4`, which is not an even number and will therefore return `False`.
Note that you can also add more test cases to cover other edge cases, such as negative numbers or very large numbers. The more test cases you have, the more comprehensive your test suite will be.
