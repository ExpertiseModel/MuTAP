 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets:
        if b == "<":
            depth += 1
        else:
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0:
            return False
    return depth == 0




# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure! Here are some test cases for the `correct_bracketing` function:
```
# Test 1: Valid brackets
brackets = "><ABC}</>def"
assert correct_bracketing(brackets)

# Test 2: Invalid brackets
brackets = "ABC</def"
assert not correct_bracketing(brackets)

# Test 3: Depth exceeds limit
brackets = "><ABC</def"
assert not correct_bracketing(brackets)

# Test 4: Depth is zero
brackets = ">ABC</def"
assert correct_bracketing(brackets)

# Test 5: Mix of valid and invalid brackets
brackets = "><ABC</defXYZ</def"
assert not correct_bracketing(brackets)

# Test 6: Empty brackets
brackets = ""
assert not correct_bracketing(brackets)

# Test 7: Brackets are nested
brackets = "><ABC</def>def"
assert correct_bracketing(brackets)

# Test 8: Brackets
