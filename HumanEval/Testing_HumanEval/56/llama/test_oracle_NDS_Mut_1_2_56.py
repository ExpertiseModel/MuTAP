    assert [/INST] Sure, I can help you generate a new test case to detect the change in the code snippet you provided. Here it is:
```python
def test():
    # Test 9: Brackets are nested with a space
    brackets = "><ABC def</def"
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == False

    # Test 10: Brackets are nested with a space and a return in the middle
    brackets = "><ABC def()</def"
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == False

    # Test 11: Brackets are nested with a space and a return at the end
    brackets = "><ABC def()</def>"
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == False

    # Test 12: Brackets are nested with a space and a return in the middle and at the end
    brackets = "><ABC def()</def>"
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == False

```
In this new test case, we are testing the following scenarios:

1. Brackets are nested with a space.
2. Brackets are nested
