    for b in brackets:
        if b == "<":
            depth += 1

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure, I can generate a new test case to detect the change in the code snippet you provided. Here's an example of a new test case that can detect the change:
```python
def test():
    # Test 9: Brackets are nested with a change in the function
    brackets = "><ABC</def>def"
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == False

    # Test 10: Brackets are nested with a change in the function
    brackets = "><ABC</def>def"
    correct_bracketing.side_effects = ["ABC"]  # simulate the change in the function
    assert correct_bracketing("ABC") == False

```
The new test case `test9()` checks the function `correct_bracketing()` with a different input, specifically with brackets that are nested with a change in the function. The `side_effects` parameter is used to simulate the change in the function, and the test case verifies that the function returns `False` in this case. The second test case `test10()` verifies that the same change in the function can be detected by the test case.
