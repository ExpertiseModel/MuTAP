    assert [/INST] Thank you for pointing that out! I'll generate a new test case to detect the change in the function `correct_bracketing`. Here's the updated test case:
```python
def test():
    # Test 9: Brackets are nested with different values
    brackets = "<ABC</def>def"
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == False

    # Test 10: Brackets are nested with different number of branches
    brackets = "<ABC</def>def</def"
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == False

    # Test 11: Brackets are nested with different order
    brackets = "</def>def</def>ABC"
    assert correct_bracketing("</def>def</def>ABC") == False

```
Please run this new test case and see if it detects the change in the function.
