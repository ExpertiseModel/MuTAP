 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.

def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets:
        if b == "<":
            depth += 1

            depth += 1
        if depth < 0:
            return False
    return depth == 0



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Understood! Here's a new test case to detect the change in the `correct_bracketing` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a deeper nesting level
    assert correct_bracketing(" ABC <!-- DEEP_NESTING --> FCG") == False
    # Test with a nested comment
    assert correct_bracketing(" ABC <!-- FOO --> FCG") == False

#</test>
