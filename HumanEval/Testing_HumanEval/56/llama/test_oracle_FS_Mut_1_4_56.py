```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. In that case, here's a new test case that can detect the change you made to the `correct_bracketing` function:
```python

```

def test():
    # Test the function with a single opening bracket
    assert correct_bracketing("<") == False
    # Test the function with a single closing bracket
    assert correct_bracketing("</") == False
    # Test the function with a single opening and closing bracket
    assert correct_bracketing("><") == False
