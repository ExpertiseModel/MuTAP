 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets:
        if b == "<":
            depth += 1
        else:
            depth -= 1
        if not (depth < 0):
            return False
    return depth == 0



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see! In that case, here's an additional test case that can detect the change in the function:
```python
def test():
    assert correct_bracketing("< ABC >") == False
    assert correct_bracketing("ABC <") == False
    assert correct_bracketing(" ABC <") == False
    assert correct_bracketing("</ABC>") == False
    assert correct_bracketing(" > ABC</") == False
    assert correct_bracketing(" ABC />") == False
    assert correct_bracketing(" ABC < >") == False

    # Add a new test case to detect the change in the function
    assert correct_bracketing(" ABC >") == True










```

This new test case checks whether the function returns `True` when the input string contains only the `>`. This test case should detect the change in the function where the `depth` variable is no longer updated when the `>` is encountered.
