    assert [/INST]  Sure! Here's a new test case that can detect the change in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test 9: Brackets are nested with a non-empty string
    brackets = "><ABC</def>def"
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == False

    # Test 10: Brackets are nested with an empty string
    brackets = ""
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == True

    # Test 11: Brackets are nested with a different syntax
    brackets = ">< ABC</def> def"
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == False

    # Test 12: Brackets are nested with a non-alpha character
    brackets = ">< ABC</def> defXyz"
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == False

```
In this new test case, we added 4 more test cases:

* Test 9: Brackets are nested with a non-empty string. This test case checks if the function correctly identifies the brackets as invalid when they are nested inside a non-
