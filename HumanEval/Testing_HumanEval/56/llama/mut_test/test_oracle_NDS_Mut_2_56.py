```python
def test():
    # Test 9: Mutated function
    assert correct_bracketing("><ABC</def") == True

    # Test 10: Mutated function with nested brackets
    assert correct_bracketing("><ABC</def>def") == False

# Test cases for the updated function
def test():
    # Test 11: Valid brackets
    assert correct_bracketing("><ABC</def") == False

    # Test 12: Valid brackets with nested brackets
    assert correct_bracketing("><ABC</def>def") == False

# Test 13: Invalid brackets
    assert correct_bracketing("ABC</def") == False

# Test 14: Depth exceeds limit

# Test 15: Brackets are empty
    assert correct_bracketing(">") == True
