#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  I understand, thank you for letting me know. Here's an additional test case that can detect the mutation in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test 9: Mutation of the function
    assert correct_bracketing("><ABC</defXYZ</def") != False

    # Test 10: Brackets are nested
    assert correct_bracketing("><ABC</def>def") == False

    # Test 11: Depth exceeds limit
    assert correct_bracketing("><ABC</def") == False

    # Test 12: Empty brackets
    assert correct_bracketing("") == True

# Additional test cases to test the mutation

```
This additional test case checks if the function correctly detects the mutation in the code snippet you provided, by checking if the function returns `False` when the brackets are nested, and `True` when the depth exceeds the limit.
