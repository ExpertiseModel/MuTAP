            depth += 1

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  I understand your concern. To detect the mutation in the `correct_bracketing` function, you can add a new test case that specifically checks for the change you mentioned. Here's an example of how you can modify the `test` function to detect this mutation:
```python
def test():
    # Test 9: Mutation in the function
    bracket = "><ABC</defXYZ</def"
    assert correct_bracketing("><ABC</defXYZ</def") == False

    # Test 10: Original function call
    assert correct_bracketing(">ABC</def") == False

```
In this modified `test` function, we add a new test case (`Test 9`) that provides the mutated input `bracket = "><ABC</defXYZ</def"`. When this input is passed to the `correct_bracketing` function, it will return `True`, as the function now correctly handles the mutated input.
We also add an additional test case (`Test 10`) that checks that the original function (`correct_bracketing`) still works correctly for the original input `>ABC</def`. This ensures that
