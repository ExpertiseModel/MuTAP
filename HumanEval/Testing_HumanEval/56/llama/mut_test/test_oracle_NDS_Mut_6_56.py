#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] I apologize for the oversight in the previous test cases. Here's a new test case that should detect the mutation in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test 9: Mutated code
    assert not correct_bracketing(">< ABC</def")`

In this test case, we provide a mutated version of the input string, where the closing bracket is moved to the end of the string. This should cause the function to return `True`, which will fail the test.
The other test cases in the `test()` function should continue to pass, ensuring that the function is working correctly for a wide range of inputs.
