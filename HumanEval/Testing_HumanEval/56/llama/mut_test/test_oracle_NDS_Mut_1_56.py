    assert [/INST] I apologize for the oversight. Here's a new test case that should detect the mutation in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test 9: Mutated function with logical negation
    brackets = "><ABC</defXYZ</def"
    assert correct_bracketing("><ABC</defXYZ</def") == True


```
This test case uses the `assert` statement to test the mutated function with a different input than the original test cases. By comparing the output of the mutated function with a known correct output, we can verify that the mutation has been detected correctly.
