#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see! Thank you for pointing that out. Here is a new test case that can detect the change in the code snippet:
```python
def test():
    # Test 9: Brackets are nested with a positive depth
    brackets = "><ABC</def>def"
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == False


    # Test 10: Brackets are nested with a negative depth
    brackets = "><ABC</def>def"
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == True


```
This new test case will check if the function returns `True` or `False` depending on whether the depth of the brackets is positive or negative. If the depth is positive, the function should return `False`, and if the depth is negative, the function should return `True`.
