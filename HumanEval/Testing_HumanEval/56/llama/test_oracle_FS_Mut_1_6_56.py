 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.

        if b != '<':
            depth += 1

    return depth == 0



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see! In that case, here's a new test case that can detect the change in the `correct_bracketing` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test with an empty string
    assert correct_bracketing("") is False

    # Test with an empty string with a nested tag
    assert correct_bracketing("</empty>") is False

    # Test with a string containing only slashes
    assert correct_bracketing("/Hello/World/) is False

    # Test with a string containing only opening tags
    assert correct_bracketing("</ABC>") is False

    # Test with a string containing only closing tags
    assert correct_bracketing(">ABC</") is False

    # Test with a string containing a mix of opening and closing tags
    assert correct_bracketing("ABC<DEF>GHI</JKL>") is False
