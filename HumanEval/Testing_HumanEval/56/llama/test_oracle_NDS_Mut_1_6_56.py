    assert correct_bracketing("><ABC}</>def") == False

    # Test 2: Invalid brackets
    assert correct_bracketing("ABC</def") == False

    # Test 3: Depth exceeds limit
    assert correct_bracketing("><ABC</def") == False

    # Test 4: Depth is zero
    assert correct_bracketing(">ABC</def") == False

    # Test 5: Mix of valid and invalid brackets
    brackets = "><ABC</defXYZ</def"
    assert correct_bracketing("><ABC</defXYZ</def") == False

    # Test 6: Empty brackets
    assert correct_bracketing("") == True

    # Test 7: Brackets are nested
    assert correct_bracketing("><ABC</def>def") == False

    # Test 8: Brackets
 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets:
        if b == "<":
            depth += 1
        else:
            depth -= 1
        if depth <= 0:
            return False
    return depth == 0



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  I understand. Here's a new test case that can detect the change in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test 9: Unexpected closing bracket
    brackets = "><ABC</defXYZ</def"
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == False

    # Test 10: Unexpected opening bracket
    brackets = "ABC</defXYZ</def"
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == False

    # Test 11: Mix of valid and invalid brackets
    brackets = "><ABC</defXYZ</defABC</def"
    assert correct_bracketing(brackets) == False

# Run the test cases
python -c "import unittest; from test import test_correct_bracketing; unittest.main()"
```
This new test case will fail if there are unexpected closing or opening brackets in the input string, and it will also fail if there is a mix of valid and invalid brackets.
