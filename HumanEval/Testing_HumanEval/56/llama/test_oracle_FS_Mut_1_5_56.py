#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    depth = 0
    for b in brackets:
        if b == "<":
            depth += 1
        else:

        if depth < 0:
            return False
    return depth == 0




#</code>

``` [/INST] ```python

    assert correct_bracketing("< ABC >") == False
    assert correct_bracketing("ABC <") == False
    assert correct_bracketing(" ABC <") == False
    assert correct_bracketing("</ABC>") == False

 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets:
        if b == "<":
            depth -= 1
        else:
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0:
            return False
    return depth == 0



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Certainly! Here's a new test case to detect the change in the function `correct_bracketing`:
```python
def test():
    assert correct_bracketing("<>< ABC >") == False
#</test>

This test case will check if the function returns `False` for the bracket sequence `"<>< ABC >"` which is a cycle of opening and closing brackets.
Let me know if you'd like me to add more test cases!
