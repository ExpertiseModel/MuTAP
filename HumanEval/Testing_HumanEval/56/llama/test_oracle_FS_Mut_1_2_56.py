#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets:
        if b == "<":
            depth += 1
        else:
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0:
            return False
    return depth == 0




#</code>

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert correct_bracketing("< ABC >") == False
    assert correct_bracketing("ABC <") == False
    assert correct_bracketing(" ABC <") == False
    assert correct_bracketing("</ABC>") == False
    assert correct_bracketing(" > ABC</") == False
    assert correct_bracketing(" ABC />") == False
    assert correct_bracketing(" ABC < >") == False

#</test>














 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    
    depth = 0
    for b in brackets:
        if b == "<":
            depth += 1
        else:
            depth -= 1
        if depth > 0:
            return False
    return depth == 0



```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the problem. The previous test cases were relying on the absolute value of the depth variable, which doesn't change when the function is modified to return `depth == 0` instead of `depth > 0`. Here's a new test case that detects the change:
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert correct_bracketing("</ABC>") == False






















```
This test case will pass as long as the function returns `False` when given the string `"</ABC>"` as input, which is the expected behavior for the modified function.
