 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def reverse_delete(s,c):
    """Task
    We are given two strings s and c, you have to deleted all the characters in s that are equal to any character in c
    then check if the result string is palindrome.
    A string is called palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
    You should return a tuple containing the result string and True/False for the check.
    Example
    For s = "abcde", c = "ae", the result should be ('bcd',False)
    For s = "abcdef", c = "b"  the result should be ('acdef',False)
    For s = "abcdedcba", c = "ab", the result should be ('cdedc',True)
    """
    s = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c])
    return (s,s[::-1] == s)
def check(candidate):

    assert candidate("abcde","ae") == ('bcd',False)
    assert candidate("abcdef", "b") == ('ac

# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure, here are some test cases for the `reverse_delete` function using Python:
```
def test():
    # Test with different input strings and characters
    assert reverse_delete("abcde", "ae") == ('bcd', False)
    assert reverse_delete("abcdef", "b") == ('acdef', False)
    # Test with a longer string
    assert reverse_delete("abcdedcba", "ab") == ('cdedc', True)

# Test with a different character to delete
def test2():
    assert reverse_delete("abcde", "ef") == ('bcd', False)

# Test with multiple characters to delete
def test3():
    assert reverse_delete("abcdef", "ab cd") == ('acdef', False)

# Test with an empty string
def test4():
    assert reverse_delete("", "a") == ('', False)

```
These test cases will cover the different scenarios that the `reverse_delete` function can handle, including:

* Deleting a single character from a string
* Deleting multiple characters from a string
*
