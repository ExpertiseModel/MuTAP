#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def is_bored(S):
    
    import re
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)
    return sum(sentence[0:2] == 'I ' for sentence in sentences)

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert is_bored("") == 0
    assert is_bored("I am curious about life, but bored with the weather. I love kittens, but I am not sure about this essay.") == 2
    assert is_bored("I am so bored.") == 1
    assert is_bored("I'm bored.") == 0
    assert is_bored("I'm really bored.") == 0
    assert is_bored("I'm super bored.") == 0
    assert is_bored("I'm not bored.") == 0
 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def is_bored(S):
    
    import re
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)
    return sum((sentence[:2] == 'I ' for sentence in sentences))

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] I understand, here's a new test case that can detect the change in the `is_bored` function:
```python
def test():
    assert is_bored("I am curious about life, but bored with the weather.") == 1
    assert is_bored("I'm bored.") == 0
    assert is_bored("I'm really bored.") == 0
    assert is_bored("I'm super bored.") == 0
    assert is_bored("I'm not bored.") == 0

```
In this test case, we added a new test for the following code snippet: `assert is_bored("I am curious about life, but bored with the weather.") == 1`. This test case will pass since the first two words of the sentence `"I am curious"` match the pattern `"I "`.
The other test cases remain the same as before.
