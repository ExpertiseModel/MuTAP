#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see. Thank you for pointing that out. Here's a new test case that should detect the mutation in the `check_dict_case` function:
```python
def test():
    # create a dictionary with only strings as keys


    # expected result: "mixed"

    assert check_dict_case({"apple": 1, "banana": 2, "orange": 3}) == "start"


    # expected result: "mixed"

    assert check_dict_case({"Apple": 1, "baNana": 2, "OrAnGe": 3}) == "mixed"

```

In this new test case, we're using a dictionary with only strings as keys, and checking if the function returns "start" or "mixed". If the function returns "start", then we know that the dictionary has only strings as keys, and the mutation in the `check_dict_case` function should be detected. If the function returns "mixed", then we know that the mutation has not been detected, and we can assume that the `check_dict_
