#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure! Here's a new test case to detect the mutation in the `check_dict_case` function:
```python
def test():
    # create a dictionary with a mix of string and non-string keys

    dict = {"apple": 1, 2: "banana", "orange": 3, ""]: 4}

    # expected result: "mixed"

    assert check_dict_case(dict) == "mixed"

```
This test case creates a dictionary with a mix of string and non-string keys, and checks if the `check_dict_case` function returns "mixed" as the state. Themutation in the original function is that it checks if the key is a string, but in this test case, we are checking if the key is any type of object (string, integer, etc.), which can include non-string objects.
