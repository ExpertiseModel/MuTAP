#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure! Here is a new test case that can detect the change in the `check_dict_case` function:
```python
def test():
    # create a dictionary with a mix of string and non-string keys

    dict = { "apple": 1, "banana": 2, 3: "orange" }

    # expected result: "mixed"

    assert check_dict_case(dict) == "mixed"



    # create a dictionary with only string keys


    dict = {"apple": 1, "banana": 2, "orange": 3}


    # expected result: "start"

    assert check_dict_case(dict) == "start"

```
The new test case creates a dictionary with both string and non-string keys, and then passes it to the `check_dict_case` function. It then checks the result to be "mixed", which indicates that the function is behaving correctly and can detect the mix of string and non-string keys.
Alternatively, you could also add more test cases to cover other corner cases, such as
