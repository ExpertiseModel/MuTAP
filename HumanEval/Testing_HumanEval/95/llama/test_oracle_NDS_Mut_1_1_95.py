#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure, here's a new test case that can detect the change in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # create a dictionary with a mix of strings and non-string keys

    dict = {"apple": 1, 2: "banana", "orange": 3, 4: "fox"}

    # expected result: "mixed"

    assert check_dict_case(dict) == "mixed"
```
In this test case, we create a dictionary with a mix of string and non-string keys, and then pass it to the `check_dict_case` function. Since the keys in the dictionary are not all strings, the `state` variable will be set to "mixed" when the function is executed, which will cause the `return` statement to return "mixed".
