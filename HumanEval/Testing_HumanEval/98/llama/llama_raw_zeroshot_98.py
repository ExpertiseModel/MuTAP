 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def count_upper(s):
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(0,len(s),2):
        if s[i] in "AEIOU":
            count += 1
    return count


# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure! Here are some test cases for the `count_upper` function:
```
# Test that the function works for a simple string
s = "Hello World!"
assert count_upper(s) == 5

# Test that the function counts uppercase letters correctly
s = "This is a TEST STRING"
assert count_upper(s) == 5

# Test that the function raises a ValueError when passed a string that is not a string type
s = 42
assert func_tests.count_upper(s) is not None

# Test that the function counts uppercase letters even when the string is empty
s = ""
assert count_upper(s) == 0

# Test that the function counts uppercase letters for a string with multiple lines
s = """This is a multiple line string
with uppercase letters
and lowercase letters too."""
assert count_upper(s) == 6

# Test that the function counts uppercase letters correctly for a string with special characters
s = """This is a string with special characters like @#$%^&*()
which have uppercase letters.
""
