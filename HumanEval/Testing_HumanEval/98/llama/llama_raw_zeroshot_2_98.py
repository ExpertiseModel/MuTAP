 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def count_upper(s):
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(0,len(s),2):
        if s[i] in "AEIOU":
            count += 1
    return count


# test case

```

def test_mixed_cases():
    s = "Hello World!"

def test_too_long_string():
