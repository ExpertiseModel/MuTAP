```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):

    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    return (a * a == (b * b) + (c // c) or b * b == (a * a) + (c * c) or c * c == (a * a) + (b * b))

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure! Here's a new test case that can detect the change in the `right_angle_triangle` function:
```python
def test():
    assert right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    assert right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 6) == False
```
Explanation:
The change in the `right_angle_triangle` function is that it now uses `//` instead of `+` for performing the division. This means that the `c * c` term in the `or` statement is now being computed using division instead of multiplication.
The new test case checks this by providing `c = 6` in the first call to `right_angle_triangle`, which should result in `b * b == (a * a) + (c * c)` being `False` since `c * c` is now `6`, not `c`.
By adding this new test case, we can ensure that the `right_angle_triangle` function still works correctly even after the change.
