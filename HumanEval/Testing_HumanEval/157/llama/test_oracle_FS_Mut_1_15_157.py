```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    return (a * a == (b * b) + (c * c) or b * b == (a ** a) + (c * c) or c * c == (a * a) + (b * b))

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Great catch! The test cases I provided earlier indeed do not detect the change in the `right_angle_triangle` function. Here's a new test case that covers the changed behavior:
```python
def test():
    assert not right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    assert not right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    assert right_angle_triangle(4, 5, 6) == False
    assert right_angle_triangle(6, 8, 10) == False
```
In this new test case, we're checking that the function returns `False` when the three sides are not right-angled, and `True` when they are.
For example, in the first test, we're checking that `right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True`, which is correct since the three sides of a right triangle have lengths 3, 4, and 5, and the function should return `True` in this case.
Similarly, in the second test, we're checking that `right_angle_triangle(1,
