```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    return (a // a == (b * b) + (c * c) or b * b == (a * a) + (c * c) or c * c == (a * a) + (b * b))

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue now. The previous test cases were based on the old implementation of the `right_angle_triangle` function, which has been modified in the updated code snippet you provided.
To detect this change, we can add a new test case that specifically checks for the new implementation. Here's an example of how you can modify the `test` function to include a new test case for the changed function:
```python
def test():
    assert right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    # Add a new test case to check the new implementation
    assert right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 6) == False
    assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False

```
In this new test case, we are passing values `3`, `4`, and `6` to the `right_angle_triangle` function, which are not the same values as in the previous test cases. This will ensure that the function correctly returns `False` for these values, as the right-angled triangle condition
