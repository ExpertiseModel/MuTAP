#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    return a*a == b*b + c*c or b*b == a*a + c*c or c*c == a*a + b*b


# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    # Test with a right-angled triangle
    assert right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    # Test with a non-right-angled triangle
    assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False

    # Test with a triangle where two sides are equal
    assert right_angle_triangle(3, 3, 4) == False

    # Test with a triangle where one side is zero
    assert right_angle_triangle(0, 1, 2) == False

    # Test with a triangle where one side is negative

    assert [/INST] Thank you for providing the updated code for the `right_angle_triangle` function. Here are some additional test cases that can help detect the change in the function:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a right-angled triangle
    assert right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True

    # Test with a non-right-angled triangle
    assert right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False

    # Test with a triangle where two sides are equal
    assert right_angle_triangle(3, 3, 4) == False

    # Test with a triangle where one side is zero
    assert right_angle_triangle(0, 1, 2) == False

    # Test with a triangle where one side is negative
    assert right_angle_triangle(3, -4, 5) == False

    # Test with a triangle where two sides are negative
    assert right_angle_triangle(3, -4, -5) == False

```
The new test cases include:

1. Testing whether the function returns `True` for
