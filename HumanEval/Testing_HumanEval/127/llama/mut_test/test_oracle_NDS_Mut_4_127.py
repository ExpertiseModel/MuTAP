#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] I understand. Here's a new test case that can detect the expected mutation in the `is_prime` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test 5: Non-primitive length with a composite number
    assert intersection((1, 2), (3, 4)) == "NO"

```
Explanation:

In this test case, we pass two intervals (`(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`) to the `intersection` function, which should return "NO" since the length of the first interval is not prime (it is 2, which is a composite number). If the mutation in the `is_prime` function were to change the return value of `is_prime(2)` to `True`, this test case would pass, but the function would still be broken.
Note that this test case only tests the mutation in the `is_prime` function and does not touch the other parts of the `intersection` function. You may want to add more test cases to cover other edge cases and functionality of the `intersection` function.
