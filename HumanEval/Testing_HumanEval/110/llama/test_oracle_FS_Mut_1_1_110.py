def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    
    odd = 0
    even = 0
    for i in lst1:
        if i%2 == 1:
            odd -= 1
    for i in lst2:

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] I understand, here's a new test case that can detect the change in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    lst1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
    lst2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    assert exchange(lst1, lst2) == "NO"
    lst1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
    lst2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    assert exchange(lst1, lst2) == "YES"
```
This test case checks whether the function `exchange` returns "YES" when the two lists are swapped, and "NO" otherwise. By swapping the lists, we are able to test the new code snippet you provided.
