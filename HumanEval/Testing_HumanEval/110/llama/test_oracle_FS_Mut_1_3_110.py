#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  To detect the change in the function `exchange` caused by the modification in the last line, you can add a new test case that checks the return value of the function for the updated logic. Here's an example of how you can modify the `test()` function to include this new test case:
```python
def test():
    # Test the original implementation of exchange
    assert exchange( [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == "YES"

    # Test the updated implementation of exchange
    lst1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
    lst2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    assert exchange(lst1, lst2) == "NO"

```
In this new test case, we are passing the same `lst1` and `lst2` as before, but we are expecting the return value of the function to be "NO" instead of "YES". This test case will fail if the updated implementation of `exchange` returns "YES" for the given inputs, which means that
