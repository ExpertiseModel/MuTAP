    assert [/INST] Sure, here's a new test case that can detect the change in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    lst1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
    lst2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    # Test the original function
    assert exchange(lst1, lst2) == "YES"
    # Modify the function to detect the change
    lst1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
   lst2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    odd = 0
    even = 0
    for i in lst1:
        if not (i % 2 == 1):
            odd += 1
    for i inlst2:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            even += 1
    if even >= odd:
        return "YES"
    return "NO"

```
This test case will pass when the original function is called with the given input, and will fail when the function is modified to detect
