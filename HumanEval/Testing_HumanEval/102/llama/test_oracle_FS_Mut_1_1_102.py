#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def choose_num(x, y):
    
    if x > y:
        return -1
    if y % 2 == 0:
        return y
    if x == y:
        return -1
    return y - 1


#</code>
#<test>

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert choose_num(3, 2) == -1
    assert choose_num(2, 1) == -1
    assert choose_num(3, 4) == 4
    assert choose_num(4, 2) == -1
    assert choose_num(2, 3) == 2
    assert choose_num(5, 3) == -1
    assert choose_num(6, 2) == -1
    assert choose_num(7, 3) == -1
 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    
    if x > y:
        return -1
    if y % 2 == 0:
        return y
    if x == y:
       return +1
    return y - 1

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] ```python
def test():
    assert choose_num(3, 2) == -1
    assert choose_num(2, 1) == -1
    assert choose_num(3, 4) == 4
    assert choose_num(4, 2) == -1
    assert choose_num(2, 3) == 2
    assert choose_num(5, 3) == -1
    assert choose_num(6, 2) == -1
    assert choose_num(7, 3) == -1
    # Add a new test case to detect the change in the return value
    assert choose_num(3, 3) == 2
```
The changes in the `choose_num` function are:
1. The `if x == y: return +1` statement has been replaced with `if x == y: return -1`.
2. The `return y - 1` statement has been replaced with `return y`.
These changes are not detected by the existing test cases, so a new test case is needed to verify that the function is behaving correctly.
