#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    if x > y:
        return -1
    if y % 2 == 0:
        return y
    if x == y:
        return -1
    return y - 1

 def test():
    
    assert choose_num(3, 2) == -1
    assert choose_num(2, 1) == -1
    assert choose_num(3, 4) == 4
    assert choose_num(4, 2) == -1
    assert choose_num(2, 3) == 2
    assert choose_num(5, 3) == -1
    assert choose_num(6, 2) == -1
    assert choose_num(7, 3) == -1
 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    
    if x >= y:
        return -1
    if y % 2 == 0:
        return y
    if x == y:
        return -1
    return y - 1

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure, here's a new test case that can detect the change in the `choose_num` function:
```python
def test():
    assert choose_num(3, 2) == -1
    assert choose_num(2, 1) == -1
    assert choose_num(3, 4) == 4
    assert choose_num(4, 2) == -1
    assert choose_num(2, 3) == 2
    assert choose_num(5, 3) == -1
    assert choose_num(6, 2) == -1
    assert choose_num(7, 3) == -1
    # Add a new test case to check for the absence of a return statement in the else block
    assert choose_num(8, 4) == 4
```
In this new test case, we added a test for the absence of a return statement in the else block of the `choose_num` function. Prior to the change, the else block did not have a return statement, and this test case will now fail if the function is modified to include a return statement in the else block.
