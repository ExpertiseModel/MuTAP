def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    """Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,
    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,
    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,
    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,
    and it may contain duplicates.
    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you
    should return the list sorted by that rule.
    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.
    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.
    You may assume that all words will have the same length.
    For example:
    assert list_sort(["aa", "a", "aaa"]) => ["aa"]
    assert list_sort(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"]) => ["ab", "cd"]

    assert [/INST]  Sure! I'd be happy to help you with your Python coding questions. Here's how I can assist you:
1. Code snippets: I can provide you with code snippets for various Python concepts and functions, such as lists, dictionaries, strings, loops, conditionals, functions, etc.
2. Code writing: If you have a specific task or problem to solve, I can write Python code to help you achieve your goal. Please provide me with the necessary details, and I'll do my best to provide you with a working solution.
3. Syntax checking: If you have a piece of Python code and want to know if it's syntactically correct, I can help you with that. Just provide me with the code, and I'll check it for any syntax errors.
4. Code debugging: If you have a Python script or module that's not working as expected, I can help you debug it. Please provide me with the code, and I'll do my best to identify the issue and suggest a solution.
5. Best practices: I can also provide you with guidance on best practices for writing clean, readable, and maintainable Python code.
