 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def get_row(lst, x):
    
    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst)) for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
    return sorted(sorted(coords, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True), key=lambda x: x[0])


# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Certainly! Here are some test cases for the `get_row` function:
```
# Test with a simple list
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Test with a specific element in the list
x = 2
assert get_row(lst, x) == [0, 1, 2]

# Test with multiple elements in the list
x = [2, 3]
assert get_row(lst, x) == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# Test with a list with no elements that match the given element
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
x = 6
assert get_row(lst, x) == []

# Test with a list with multiple elements that match the given element
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2]
x = 2
assert get_row(lst, x) == [0, 2, 3, 4]

# Test with a list that is not a square matrix
lst =
