#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
            number_as_string = str(num)
            if int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits:
                count += 1
        
    return count 


# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert specialFilter([]) == 0


    assert specialFilter([4]) == 0


    assert specialFilter([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) == 0


    assert specialFilter([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) == 0

 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test(), cannot detect the mutation in the following code snippet.
```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    
    
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
            number_as_string = str(num)
            if (int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[-1]) not in odd_digits):
                count += 1
        
    return count 

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure! Here is a new test case that can detect the mutation in the `specialFilter` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test the mutated function
    assert specialFilter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 2

    # Test the original function
    assert specialFilter([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) == 2

```
In this test case, we are testing both the mutated and original versions of the `specialFilter` function with a sample input of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. For the mutated function, we expect the count to be 2, since only the odd numbers in the input will be filtered. For the original function, we expect the count to be 2 as well, since both odd and even numbers will be filtered.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
