```python

    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
            number_as_string = str(num)
            if (int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits or int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits):
                count += 1
        
    return count 

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure! Here's a new test case that can detect the mutation in the `specialFilter` function:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a list of odd integers
    assert specialFilter([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]) == 3

    # Test with a list of even integers
    assert specialFilter([2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]) == 0

    # Test with a list of mixed integers
    assert specialFilter([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]) == 2

```
The new test case checks the function`s behavior with a list of odd integers, even integers, and a mix of odd and even integers. By doing so, it can detect the mutation in the function caused by the addition of the new `or` statement.
