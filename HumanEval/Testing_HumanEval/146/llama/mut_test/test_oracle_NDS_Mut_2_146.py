            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)

    return count 

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  To detect the mutation in the `specialFilter` function, we can add a test case that checks for a specific edge case, such as an input list containing only odd numbers. Here's an updated test case that should catch the mutation:
```python
def test():
    assert specialFilter([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) == 2

    assert specialFilter([2, 4, 6, 8]) == 0

    assert specialFilter([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]) == 2

```
In this update test case, we're testing the `specialFilter` function with three different input lists: one containing only odd numbers, one containing only even numbers, and one that contains both odd and even numbers. We're checking the output of the function for each input list to ensure it's correct.
With this updated test case, the test suite should be able to detect the mutation in the `specialFilter` function when an input list containing only odd numbers is given.
