    return count 


# test case

    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
            number_as_string = str(num)
            if (int(number_as_string[0]) not in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits):

    return count

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure, I'd be happy to generate a new test case to detect the mutation in the `specialFilter` function. Here is an example of how you could modify the `test` function to detect the mutation:
```python
def test():
    # Mutated code
    specialFilter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # Should fail

    # Original code
    assert specialFilter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 0

```
In this example, we have added a new test case that passes the `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` list to the `specialFilter` function. Since the list contains numbers less than 10, the function should return 1, which means that the mutation has been detected.
You can add more test cases to cover more edge cases and to ensure that the function is working correctly.
It's also a good practice to name your test cases with a clear description of what they are testing, so you can easily identify the purpose of each test case.
