    return count

    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
            number_as_string = str(num)
            if (int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[+1]) in odd_digits):
                count += 1
        
    return count 

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see. Here's a new test case that can detect the mutation you introduced:
```python
def test():
    # Test for the mutation in the "specialFilter" function
    assert specialFilter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 0
    # Test for the original behavior
    assert specialFilter([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) == 0
```
This test case will pass if the `specialFilter` function behaves as expected for both the original and mutated code, and will fail if the mutated code is executed.
