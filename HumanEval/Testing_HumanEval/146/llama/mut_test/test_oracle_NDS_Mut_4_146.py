    return count 


# test case

    assert specialFilter([4]) == 0

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    
    
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
            number_as_string = str(num)
            if not ((int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits)):
                count += 1
        
    return count 

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure, here's a new test case that can detect the mutation in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test with a modified function
    new_nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    assert specialFilter(new_nums) == 5 # Should detect the mutation
```
In this test case, we're passing in a modified list of numbers to the `specialFilter` function, and checking if the count returned is 5. If the mutation is present, the `count` returned by the modified function will be different from 5, and the test will fail.
