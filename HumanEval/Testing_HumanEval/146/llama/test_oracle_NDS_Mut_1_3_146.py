#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    return count 


# test case

    assert specialFilter([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) == 0

 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    
    
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)

                count += 1
        
    return count 

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Ah, I see the issue. The previous test cases were only checking if the first digit of the number was odd, but the function has been modified to check if both the first and last digit of the number are odd. Here's a new test case that detects this change:
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert specialFilter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 0


    assert specialFilter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == 1


    assert specialFilter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 0

```
Explanation:

* The first test case checks that the function returns 0 when the input list contains only even numbers.
* The second test case checks that the function returns 1 when the input list contains only odd numbers.
* The third test case checks that the function returns 0 when the input list contains both even and odd numbers.


Note: The ` assert` statement is used to assert that the function
