 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    
    
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
            number_as_string = str(num)
            if not ((int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits)):

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure, I can help you generate a new test case to detect the change in the code snippet you provided. Here is an updated test case:
```python
def test():
    # Test the new code snippet
    assert specialFilter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 5

    # Test the old code snippet
    assert specialFilter([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) == 3

```
In this test case, we have added a new test for the changed code snippet, where we pass a list of numbers that includes all the numbers between 1 and 10. We expect the new code snippet to return 5, which is the number of odd numbers in the list.
We have also kept the old test case to ensure that the new test case does not break the existing functionality.
You can run these test cases using a test runner like `unittest` to check if they pass or fail.
