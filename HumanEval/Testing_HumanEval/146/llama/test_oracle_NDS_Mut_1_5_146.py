#Generate test cases for the following function:```python

    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
            number_as_string = str(num)
            if int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits and int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits:
                count += 1
        
    return count 


# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    assert specialFilter([]) == 0


    assert specialFilter([4]) == 0


    assert specialFilter([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) == 0


    assert specialFilter([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) == 0

 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    
    
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
            number_as_string = str(num)
            if (int(number_as_string[0]) in odd_digits or int(number_as_string[-1]) in odd_digits):
                count += 1
        
    return count 

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure, here's a new test case that can detect the change in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test the new code snippet
    nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    assert specialFilter(nums) == 5
    # Test the old code snippet
    nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    assert specialFilter(nums) == 0
```
In this test case, we're passing the same `nums` list to both the old and new functions, and checking the result. Since the new code snippet includes an additional condition for the last digit of the number, we expect the result to be different in the new case.
Note that this test case assumes that the `specialFilter` function works correctly for the given input list in both the old and new versions. If the function behaves differently for other input lists, you may need to add additional test cases to cover those scenarios.
