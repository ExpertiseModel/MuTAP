    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            odd_digits = (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)

#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] I understand. Here's a new test case that can detect the change in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    # Test when the input list contains odd numbers only
    nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
    assert specialFilter([1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]) == 4

    # Test when the input list contains both odd and even numbers
    nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
    assert specialFilter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]) == 3

    # Test when the input list is empty
    nums = []
    assert specialFilter([]) == 0

```
In this new test case, we're testing the `specialFilter` function with different inputs, including a list containing only odd numbers, a list containing both odd and even numbers, and an empty list. We're expecting the function to return the correct count of numbers that meet the condition for each input.
