#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure! Here's a new test case that can detect the change in the code snippet you provided:
```python
def test():
    assert specialFilter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == 0

    assert specialFilter([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]) == 1

    assert specialFilter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == -1
```
In this new test case, we're testing the `specialFilter` function with different input lists, including a list of all positive integers up to 10, a list of all positive integers from 10 to 100, and a list of consecutive positive integers from 1 to 10. The expected result for each input list is different, so we can use these test cases to verify that the `specialFilter` function is working correctly.
