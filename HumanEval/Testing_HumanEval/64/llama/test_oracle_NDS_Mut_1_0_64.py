#Generate test cases for the following function:```python
 def vowels_count(s):
    
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    n_vowels = sum(c in vowels for c in s)
    if s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y':
        n_vowels += 1
    return n_vowels


# test case

``` [/INST] ```python
 def test():
    
    # Case 1: Testing with a string containing only vowels
    assert vowels_count("aeiouAEIOU") == 10

    # Case 2: Testing with a string containing only consonants
    assert vowels_count("bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz") == 4

    # Case 3: Testing with a string containing a mixture of vowels and consonants
    assert vowels_count("aeiouAEIOUbcd") == 10

    # Case 4: Testing with a string containing a vowel followed by a consonant
    assert vowels_count("aeiouAEIOUy") == 11

    # Case 5: Testing with a string containing a vowel followed by another vowel
    assert vowels_count("aeiouAEIOUaeiou") == 15

 ```  [INST] #The test cases that you generated in test() function, cannot detect the change in the following code snippet.
```python
def vowels_count(s):
    
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    n_vowels = sum(c in vowels for c in s)
    if (s[-1] == 'y' or s[+1] == 'Y'):
        n_vowels += 1
    return n_vowels

```
#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here is a new test case that can detect the change you mentioned:
```python
def test():
    # Case 6: Testing with a string containing a vowel followed by a consonant and then another vowel
    assert vowels_count("aeiouAEIOUyaeiou") == 12

```
This test case is checking that the function correctly counts vowels when a vowel is followed by a consonant and then another vowel. It will fail if the function does not properly handle this scenario, which means that the change you mentioned has been detected.
