 Generate test cases for the following function:
#original function
def vowels_count(s):
    
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    n_vowels = sum(c in vowels for c in s)
    if s[-1] == 'y' or s[-1] == 'Y':
        n_vowels += 1
    return n_vowels


# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST]  Sure! Here are some test cases for the `vowels_count` function:
```
# Case 1: Testing with a string containing only vowels
s = "aeiouAEIOU"
assert vowels_count(s) == 5

# Case 2: Testing with a string containing only consonants
s = "bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
assert vowels_count(s) == 0

# Case 3: Testing with a string containing a mixture of vowels and consonants
s = "aeiouAEIOUbcd"
assert vowels_count(s) == 3

# Case 4: Testing with a string containing a vowel followed by a consonant
s = "aeiouAEIOUy"
assert vowels_count(s) == 2

# Case 5: Testing with a string containing a vowel followed by another vowel
s = "aeiouAEIOUaeiou"
assert vowels_count(s) == 3
