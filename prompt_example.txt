"This test case checks for the scenario where both x 
and y are equal. In the modified code, the condition 
if x != y will evaluate to False, and the expected 
result is -1. However, in the original code,
the condition if x == y will evaluate to True, and 
the incorrect result would be y - 1, which is 4 
instead of -1."
